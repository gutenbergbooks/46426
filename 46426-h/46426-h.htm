RUSKIN'S CHAIR</p>

<p class="inno">"This is all very well," said a visitor, after looking over the
sketches and books of the Ruskin Museum at Coniston, "but
what the public would prefer is to see the chair he sat in."
Something tangible, that brings before us the person, rather
than his work, is what we all like; for though successful
workers are continually asking us to judge them by what they
have done, we know there is more. We want to see their
portraits; their faces will tell us&mdash;better than their books&mdash;whether
we can trust them. We want to know their lives by
signs and tokens unconsciously left, before we fall down and
worship them for what, after all, may be only a lucky accident
of success. They cry out indignantly that this should not be;
but so it is.</p>

<p>Relics of heroes even the ancient Romans treasured. Relics
of saints our forefathers would fight for and die for. Relics
of those who in modern times have made our lives better and
brighter we need not be ashamed of preserving. And among
relics I count all the little incidents, the by-play of life, the
anecdotes which betray character, so long as they are truly told
and "lovingly," as George Richmond said about his portrait of
Ruskin. "Have not you flattered him?" asked the severe
parents. "No; it is only the truth lovingly told."</p>

<p>In his study you see two chairs; one, half-drawn from the
table, with pen and ink laid out before it, where he used to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
at his writing; the light from the bay window coming broadly
in at his left hand, and the hills, when he lifted his eyes, for
his help. The other, by the fireside, was the arm chair into
which he migrated for those last ten years of patience, no
longer with his own books but others' books before him.
Then, turning to the chapter on his Music, you can see the
chair by the drawing-room table, in which, making a pulpit of
it, he preached his baby sermon&mdash;"People, be dood!"</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S STUDY AT BRANTWOOD</p></div>
</div>

<p>But it is about another kind of chair that I have more to
say in this first chapter, if you will forgive the pun; the
metaphorical chair which professors are supposed to fill at the
University. Ruskin's was nominally that of Fine Art, but he
was really a sort of teaching Teufelsdr√∂ckh, Professor of
Things in General. His chair stood on four legs, or even
more, like some antique settles of carved oak; very unlike the
Swiss milking-stool of the modern specialist. Not that it
stood more firmly; good business-folk, whose sons fell under
his influence, and dons with an eye to college successes in the
schools, thought his teaching deplorable; and from their point
of view much was to be said. It cannot be denied, also, that
like the born teacher he was, he sometimes tried to make silk
purses out of sows' ears.</p>

<p>He taught none of us to paint saleable pictures nor to
write popular books. A pupil once asked him outright to do
so. "I hope you're not serious," he replied. To learn the
artist's trade he definitely advised going to the Royal Academy
schools; his drawing school at Oxford was meant for an almost
opposite purpose&mdash;to show the average amateur that really
Fine Art is a worshipful thing, far beyond him; to be
appreciated (and that alone is worth while) after a course of
training, but never to be attained unless by birth-gift.</p>

<p>At the start this school, provided by the Professor at his
own cost of time, trouble and money, was well attended; in
the second year there were rarely more than three pupils. It
was in 1872 that I joined it, having seen him before, introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a><br /><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by Mr. Alfred W. Hunt, R.W.S., the landscape painter.
Ruskin asked to see what I had been doing, and I showed him
a niggled and panoramic bit of lake-scenery. "Yes, you have
been looking at Hunt and Inchbold." I hoped I had been
looking at Nature. "You must learn to draw." Dear me!
thought I, and I have been exhibiting landscapes. "And you
try to put in more than you can manage." Well, I supposed
he would have given me a good word for that!</p>

<p>So he set me to facsimile what seemed like a tangle of
scrabbles in charcoal, and I bungled it. Whereupon I had to
do it again, and was a most miserable undergraduate. But the
nice thing about him was that he did not say, "Go away; you
are no good"; but set me something drier and harder still.
I had not the least idea what it was all coming to; though
there was the satisfaction of looking through the sliding cases
between whiles at "Liber Studiorum" plates&mdash;rather ugly, some
of them, I whispered to myself&mdash;and little scraps of Holbein
and Burne-Jones, quite delicious, for I had the pre-Raphaelite
measles badly just then, in reaction from the water-colour
landscape in which I had been brought up. Only I was too
ignorant to see, till he showed me, that the virtue of real pre-Raphaelite
draughtsmanship was in faithfulness to natural form,
and resulting sensitiveness to harmony of line; nothing to do
with sham medi√¶valism and hard contours.</p>

<p>By-and-by he promoted me to Burne-Jones's "Psyche
received into Heaven." What rapture at the start, and what
trials before that facsimile was completed! And when all was
done, "That's not the way to draw a foot," said a popular
artist who saw the copy. But that was the way to use the pure
line, and who but Ruskin taught it at the time?</p>

<p>Later, he set painful tasks of morsels from Turner, distasteful
at first, but gradually fascinating; for he would not
let one off before getting at the bottom of the affair, whether
it was merely a knock-in of the balanced colour-masses or the
absolute imitation of the little wavy clouds, an eighth of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
inch long, left apparently ragged by the mezzotinter's scraper.
All this does not make a professional picture-painter, but such
teaching must have opened many pupils' eyes to certain points
in art not universally perceived.</p>

<p>That was one leg of the chair; another was the literary leg.
He contemplated his "Bibliotheca Pastorum," anticipating in
a different form the best hundred books, only there were to be
far less. The first, as suited in his mind for country readers on
St. George's farms, was the "Economist" of Xenophon, and two
of his undergraduate friends undertook the translation. Of
these, Wedderburn of Balliol, now K.C., and Ruskin's literary
executor, was one; and the other was Montefiore of Balliol,
who was already in weak health (he did not live long after
those days) and passed on his share in the work to me. That
was the beginning of many interesting afternoons in Ruskin's
rooms, where I read my bit of translation to him, and he
compared it with the Greek, revising and Ruskinising the
schoolboy exercise. His method of translation was quite new
to me. The Greek was not to be so turned into English as
to lose its Greek flavour; one should know it for a rendering
out of a foreign tongue. The same word in Greek was to be
represented by the same word in English. He would have no
more "freedom" in this than in anything else. But he came
down heavily on all the catchwords and commonplaces dear to
Bohn's cribs, and for a phrase like "to boot" had no mercy.
On the other hand, he invented quaint renderings of his own,
such as "courtesy" for <em>philanthropia</em>. The book is still in print
for the curious to read; he gave his translators the profits:
"It will keep you in raspberry jam," he said, and I have had
a postal order for my share regularly these nearly thirty years.
But the lesson one learns at school in Latin, how to make
mosaic of words and decorative patterns of phrases, no master
ever tried to teach me in English, as Ruskin taught it over the
tea-cups in those afternoons at Corpus.</p>

<p>There was a third leg to the chair, which we might call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
dignity of labour. When his first group of men would not
draw, he made them dig at Hinksey. I was slack at the
Hinksey diggings, but he made me dig at Coniston. When
the Xenophon was nearly ready, the translators were asked to
Brantwood in the summer of 1875 to finish it. At my earliest
visit, two years before, he had no harbour; the boats were
exposed to the big waves from the south-west storms, and it
was an almost daily task for the gardeners to keep them
aground on the shore and to bale them. In '74 he began
some harbour-works, which we were set to complete. We dug
and built every afternoon, and enjoyed it, though we had not
time to finish the job. After us the local mason was called in,
so that the harbour you now see is professional work. But he
bade them leave three of my steps standing as a monument of
that summer's doings, and there they are to this day.</p>

<p>It seemed a kind of joke to make Oxford men dig, and I
think the Hinksey work was devised partly in despair of otherwise
holding his class together. But he had reasons for
accustoming them to the labour by which far the greater part
of humanity has to live. Not to make them into navvies, but
to give them a respect for the skilled use of a pick and a
trowel, was his intention; just as the drawing school was not to
make them artists, but to show them how hard it was. In his
own undergraduate days the yokel and the mob were outside
the pale of the gownsman's interests. There was condescending
charity, of course, and comradeship in sport with the keeper
and the groom; but "your real gentleman," said Byron,
"never perspires." On the contrary, said Ruskin, when Adam
delved, in the sweat of his brow, life was nearest to Eden-gates.
"To draw hard breath over ploughshare and spade"
was the glory of living. And so, to make these youngsters
dig was an object-lesson in ethics, the first rudiments of human
fellowship, which branched upward into all the moralities.</p>

<p>A fourth leg to his chair was nature study. In those days
"science" was supposed to be the only true natural history:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Gilbert White was out of date. Ruskin's teaching was a
protest, and it has prevailed.</p>

<p>From any master we learn no more than we are capable of
learning, and he never gave me many of the tasks he put upon
others of his pupils. Less for any use he made of it, but
always with the suggestion that it was for a practical end, he
set me to draw glaciers and glaciated rocks at Chamouni; on
the Coniston fells demonstrated his method of taking dip and
strike from any bit of rock showing cleavage and stratification,
and on his own piece of moor made me survey and elaborate a
model to scale. It was treated as a form of sport, enjoyable
as any game; but not to be scamped. There was always the
insistence on accuracy above all things, and fulness of observation,
with care about trifles which I had not dreamed of before,
and never expected from him. It was only much later that I
understood, from his note-books and sketch-books, what an
immense amount of dry, hard work underlay the easy eloquence
of his paragraphs. For instance, "Love's Meinie" seems to
be a slight performance; but to serve for it he had a vast
collection of unstuffed bird-skins, and to get at the secret of
flight planned and commissioned from a skilled artificer sets
of quill-feathers, enormously magnified, in exact imitation of
the true forms and proportions in the bird's wing. One of
these is on view in the Coniston museum, which holds so many
of his relics; a complete set are still at Brantwood. To show
the village children how the wheels of heaven go round, and
how the stars have been grouped into pictures of the world&mdash;old
myths of nature, he planned a revolving globe into which you
could climb and see a blue sky pierced for the greater and the
lesser lights, and painted with the constellation figures. The
globe has perished, but the object-lesson in education remains.</p>

<p>I have mentioned four lines of his teaching, four legs to his
chair. Other traits of his many-sided mind are given in the
following chapters, and even these are not exhaustive. They
will serve to show him as he was seen at close quarters, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
merely through the medium of print&mdash;the last of the sages,
lingering into an era of specialists. I do not rate him as an
infallible authority, neither in taste, nor in ethics, nor in anything.
But he was a great teacher, because he took you by the
hand as he went on his voyage of discovery through the world;
he made you see what he saw, and taught you to look for
yourself.</p>

<p>One thing he never taught me was to keep a diary. He
used to lament how many beautiful sunsets he had not sketched,
and how many interesting facts he had lost for want of the
scratch of a pencil. In trying to recall these bygones one
begins to perceive their loss: so little one can save from the
wreckage of time. Once, when his talk was rather confidential,
I said, "Never mind, I'm not Boswell taking notes." "I
think," he replied, "you might do worse."</p>

<p class="chap">II<br />
RUSKIN'S "JUMP"</p>


<p class="inno">"Jump" was the Brantwood vernacular for "Jumping Jenny";
and she was Ruskin's own private, particular "water sulky," as
the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table put it. There is hardly
any need to say that she was named after the famous though
somewhat disreputable brig, commanded and partly owned by
the late Anthony Ewart, not unknown to readers of Ruskin's
favourite novel "Redgauntlet." I do not mean to commit
myself to any statement of literary criticism in calling "Redgauntlet"
his favourite novel, or to imply that he thought it
the best book ever written: but it was one which he continually
quoted in conversation and discussed with pleasure in his autobiography.
Of all the novels he read in those evenings of
"auld lang syne," when he pulled the four candles close to
him at the drawing-room table, and we sketched furtively in
corners, Laurence Hilliard and I, and the ladies plied their
needles&mdash;no novel was read with more delight and effect. It
was a pretty way of passing the evening, but not so easy to
imitate unless you have a Ruskin to read to you. He had a
trick of suggesting the dramatic variety of the conversations
without trying to be stagey, and a skill in "cutting" the long
paragraphs of Scott's descriptions which made it all as good as
a play. He did not make you hot and ready to scream, as
many readers do in their anxiety to act the scene.</p>

<p>Ruskin was no sailor, and never went for a real voyage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but he was very fond of boats and shipping, and all that came
from the sea. One of his grandfathers had been a sailor. As
far as I can make out, this grandfather was an East-coast
skipper of small craft, very much like one of the captains of
"Many Cargoes" and "Sea Urchins." He had passed out of
this world before John Ruskin came into it, and the little
genius never had the luck to hear sea-stories and to learn the
mysteries of reef-knots and clove-hitch from an old captain
grandfather. It would have been so good for him! But one
must not forget that in the making of John Ruskin there was
a quarter of the blood of a seafarer. It is a rather curious fact,
also, and one which has not, I believe, been mentioned in print,
that the earliest Ruskin of all was a sea captain. Mr. W. Hutton
Brayshay tells me that he has found in the Record Office a
notice of the name in the fourteenth century; this medi√¶val
Ruskin was captain of one of Edward III.'s ships. We cannot
connect him with John Ruskin's family, any more than we can
connect the Ruskins of Dalton-in-Furness in the sixteenth
century; but this identity of name suggests that they may
have been ancestors. It is a problem which can only be solved
by research, but it should be possible, if one had time and
money to work out the pedigree from wills and registers.</p>

<p>Turner was his real teacher in seafaring matters, giving
him, if nothing more, a true interest in the look of waves and
ships. It was for Turner's sake that he wrote the fine essay on
"the boat in art and poetry" which forms the introduction to
"Harbours of England"; and this glorification of the coast
fishing-craft and the old ship of the line was not merely a
literary man's concoction, but the outcome of much study and
sketching at Deal, where he spent the summer of 1855 to steep
himself in the subject. In the early sixties, again, he stayed
for some time at Boulogne in lodgings under the sandhills
north of the pier, and made friends with a French pilot and
mackerel fisher who, after due apprenticeship, actually promoted
him to the tiller&mdash;an honour of which he was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
prouder than that election to the membership of a foreign
Academy which he forgot to answer until it was too late to say
any more about it.</p>

<p>CONISTON HALL AND BOATHOUSE</p></div>
</div>

<p>So when he came to Coniston, and had his own house on
his own lake, he could not be without boats. There was a
landing-place on the shore beneath Brantwood, shown in our
photograph as it was in the earlier stages of its development,
with Mrs. Arthur Severn and Miss Constance Hilliard (Mrs.
W. H. Churchill) on the first primitive breakwater, and Mr.
Severn's sailboat in the distance. Ruskin did not care for
lake-sailing; a busy man hardly has time to wait for the
moving of the water; and he got one of the indigenous tubs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for the diversion of rowing. He did not fish, and he had the
greatest scorn for rowing as it is done at Oxford. "That's not
rowing; that's galley-slaves' work!" he used to tell us. "To
bend to the stroke, and time your oars to the beat of the
waves," was his ideal: he liked going out when there was a
little sea on, and white horses; and he would paddle away
before the wind with great enjoyment. But when there is a
little sea on, at Coniston, it means a good deal of wind; though
the waves are not very high they gather a fair amount of force
in their four or five miles' career up the long waterway; and
the fun of riding with them is quite different from the struggle
of getting your boat home again. Now Ruskin was a very
practical man in some things. "When you have too much to
do, don't do it," he used to say. So after a wild water-gallop,
he simply landed and walked home. When the wind changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he could bring back his boat. There was no use in making a
pain of a pleasure.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S "JUMP" ADRIFT OFF BRANTWOOD</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Lake district rowing-boat is built for the Lake fisherman,
and it is as neatly adapted to its purpose as the Windermere
yacht which, for the peculiar winds and waters of the place, is
pretty nearly perfect. The fishers used to have two chief
requirements, whether they netted or trolled; the boat must
travel easily in lumpy but not violent water, for the men had
far to go in reaching their "drawing-up spots," and in taking
their fish to market of an evening; and it must carry a good
deal of tackle. In netting, there were always two partners, and
so two thwarts and two pairs of sculls were used; in trolling,
one went out alone, but there were rods and lines which needed
space for convenient stowage. Consequently the boats were
rather long, and rather low in the water; the sculls were fixed
on pins, so that you could drop them when you got a bite, or
landed hastily to take the hair-rope at your end of the net in
drawing up. Feathering the oar was quite unknown; great
speed unnecessary; great stability desirable; but not what a
sailor would call seaworthiness. On the whole, for pleasure-boating
on the lakes, these boats are safe and convenient;
accidents are extremely rare, though hundreds and perhaps
thousands of hopelessly unskilled people every summer try
their hands at rowing, and do everything you ought not to do
in a boat. It is impossible to insist on an experienced boatman
going out with every party, and not always possible to prevent
overcrowding. Local authorities have no powers, except to
hang life-buoys (at their own personal expense) on convenient
points along the shore. You will see one of the Coniston parish
council's buoys on the boathouse in our photograph of the
Hall: but you will be glad to know that it has hung there for
years without being wanted for a rescue.</p>

<p>THE RUSKIN MUSEUM, CONISTON</p></div>
</div>

<p>After some seasons' trial of the local boat, Ruskin thought
he could improve upon it for his own purpose. He wanted
something less cumbrous and more seaworthy, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
always trying experiments, uprooting notions to find how they
grew, planting them upside down to see what happened,
grafting one idea upon another, to the bewilderment of
onlookers. In the matter of boats he had a very willing and
capable helper in Laurence Hilliard, who was the cleverest and
neatest-fingered boy that ever rigged a model; and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were the models he designed and finished with exquisite perfection
of detail in the outhouse-workshop at Brantwood.
Laurie, as every one called him, was deep in Scott Russell at
that time, working away on the ponderous (and now discredited)
folio as if he were getting it up for an examination, and covering
sheets of cartridge-paper with sections and calculations. He
was only too pleased to have a hand in a real job, and turned
out the drawings and the model for the new boat in workmanlike
fashion. This was in 1879 or 1880.</p>

<p>Just opposite Brantwood, across the lake, is the old Coniston
Hall, built in the fifteenth century as the home of the Flemings
of Coniston, but nearly two hundred years ago abandoned and
left to ruin. Mrs. Radcliffe, who wrote the "Mysteries of
Udolpho"&mdash;known to most readers nowadays less for itself
than as the book that so excited the heroine of "Northanger
Abbey"&mdash;about 1794 came to Coniston, and mistook the old
Coniston Hall for Conishead Priory, as it seems: and with an
odd fallacy of romance described the "solemn vesper that once
swelled along the lake from those consecrated walls, and
awakened, perhaps, the enthusiasm of the voyager, while
evening stole upon the scene." But she was right enough in
being charmed with the spot, as Ruskin was in his boyish
visits, long before he dreamed of living&mdash;and dying&mdash;in view
of the old round chimneys among the trees, with the ripple
of lake below and the peak of the Old Man rising above.
Early in the nineteenth century the ruins were fitted up
as a farm, and, somewhat later, the boathouse close by
came to be the workshop of the man who built Ruskin's
"Jump."</p>

<p>Mr. William Bell was one of the celebrities of this dale. In
his youth he had been a sort of right-hand man of John Beever
of the Thwaite, brother to the ladies of "Hortus Inclusus,"
and author of "Practical Fly-Fishing." On the death of his
father, William Bell became the leading carpenter of the place,
and the leading Liberal, and during Mr. Gladstone's last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Administration he was nominated for a Justice of the Peace.
Ruskin was told of his neighbour, and sent word that he
would like to come and have a talk about politics. Now the
carpenter was used to Conservative orators and Liberal arguers,
but he knew that Ruskin was a different sort of man; and all
day long before the hour fixed for the visit he was in a greatly
perturbed state of mind, walking up and down and wondering&mdash;a
new thing for him&mdash;how he should tackle this unknown
personality. At last the distinguished guest arrived. He was
solemnly welcomed and shown into the parlour. The door
was shut upon the twain. The son (Mr. John Bell), who felt
he had brought into contact the irresistible force and the
irremovable post, waited about hoping it would be all right,
but in much trepidation as the sound of talk inside rose from
a murmur to a rumble, and from a rumble to a roar. At last
his father's well-known voice came through the partition in no
trembling accents: "Ye're wrong to rags, Mr. Ruskin!"
Then he knew it <em>was</em> all right, and went about his work. And
after that Ruskin and "ald Will Bell" were firm friends in
spite of differences.</p>

<p>So Will Bell built the "Jump"&mdash;or, to be accurate, was
master-builder, employing at this job Mont. Barrow, well
known to boat-owners on Windermere for one of the most
skilful of craftsmen, as his father was before him&mdash;and one fine
day in spring she was launched at the boat-house with great
ceremony. A wreath of daffodils was hung round her bows,
and Miss Martha Gale christened her, with this little versicle
which Ruskin made for the occasion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Waves give place to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven send grace to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune to ferry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind hearts and merry!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was one strange face in the group, one uninvited
visitor. The people then at the Hall were not successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
managers, though they had interested Ruskin, perhaps more
through the idyllic prettiness of their homestead than otherwise.
He had helped to stave off the failure by lending them ¬£300,
which they proposed to pay in geese! And the stranger at the
launch was the man in possession. Alas! for "these consecrated
walls," and the disillusionments of our Arcadia. Perhaps
it is wise to add, in plain words, that twenty years have
wrought changes at the Hall, and that the present tenants are
quite different people.</p>

<p>TRIAL MODEL FOR THE "JUMPING JENNY"</p></div>
</div>

<p>The "Jump," so launched at last, was always Ruskin's own
boat, for his private particular use. Sometimes as a special
honour the favoured guest was sent across the lake in her, rather
than in a common boat; but to say the truth, if it wasn't for
the honour of the thing, as the Irishman remarked when the
bottom of the sedan-chair came out, we had as soon walk
round. She rode the waves beautifully, but you didn't seem
to get forrarder with her. Perhaps it was the fallacy of the
Scott Russell lines that made her heavy, or must we put all the
blame upon Ruskin? He tried to build a boat that would sail
and row equally well, and that is not easy. She was never
sailed, though the model, now in the Coniston Museum, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
rigged. The "Jump," still on the water and often used, is
treasured, I think, chiefly as a relic&mdash;Ruskin's flagship. When
she is repainted, the old pattern round the gunwale, his
device, and the brilliant blue, his favourite colour, are
always reproduced, and she looks sound enough to outlast
us all.</p>

<p>At a later time, when he was staying at Sandgate (1887-88),
he reverted to his fondness for boating, and had several
very beautiful models built and rigged by Charles Dalby, of
Folkestone, a past-master in the mystery. These models&mdash;the
old Dover packet, old-style cutter and yawl, and so forth&mdash;are
still at Brantwood.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1882, during a visit to London, Mr.
Froude described to him the discovery of a Viking ship,
which roused great interest. Writing home, he sketched it
endwise and sidewise, with notes of its construction, and&mdash;"Froude
told me she had a horse at the head." To most of
his readers Ruskin has been exclusively the arm-chair philosopher,
the dilettante of prints and pictures; but there was a
vein of the old blood in him, as in the rest of us, which
warmed to the rough sea-life that created Venice (read his prose
poem thereon in "Modern Painters," vol. v., "The Wings of
the Lion"), and England:&mdash;"Bare head, bare fist, bare foot,
and blue jacket. If these will not save us, nothing will." He
has told me of talks with Carlyle, who regretted he had not
taken up the Kings of Norway earlier in life, instead of
Frederick the Great, and spent his better strength upon the
better subject; and Ruskin himself, though too late for
evidences of the taste to appear in his writings, liked to hear
of our seafaring ancestors of the North. It was a touch of
this feeling that made him so scornful of "sailing-machines,"
not calling them boats at all. He would not even have a
boat-house for his "Jump"; it would be too like yachting, and
she must lie on the beach, in open harbour, in the good old
way. When we used to laugh at Laurence Hilliard's "Snail,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a Morecambe Bay fisherman's craft that wouldn't go, Ruskin
always took her part. "You boys can't be content unless you
are going fast. I won't have her called the 'Snail'; she is&mdash;"
and this with his own peculiar lifting emphasis&mdash;"a Real Sea
Boat."</p>

RUSKIN'S GARDENING</p>

<p class="inno">There are two quite different sorts of garden lovers&mdash;those
who raise flowers, and those who look for the landscape effect.
I shall be scolded for saying so, but the first often make their
gardens into museums; very interesting, no doubt, but not so
pleasant to live with as the half-wild bit of ground&mdash;lawn,
trees and shrubbery, without a pane of glass in evidence&mdash;where
there are just enough flowers, hardy perennials perhaps, to give
a touch of colour in their season, but in the main a sense of
green repose. I think the garden which the Lord planted
eastward in Eden was like that; a pleasance, where He could
walk in the cool of the evening with Adam, and Adam had no
need to run away, every minute, to look for slugs.</p>

<p>Ruskin, though he wrote about botany, and tried to be his
own Linn√¶us, and though he loved well enough to see flowers
(especially wild ones) on his table and outside his window, yet in
his practical gardening was quite the landscapist. He liked
making paths and contriving pretty nooks, building steps and
bridges, laying out beds, woodcutting and so forth; but I never
remember him potting and grafting and layering and budding;
and as to the rarity of any plants in his garden, I believe he
took far more pleasure in the wood-anemone&mdash;Silvia, he
called it&mdash;than in anything buyable from the nurseryman's
catalogue.</p>

<p>The Brantwood gardens as they now are, enlarged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tended by a mistress who loves and understands flowers, and
glorified by their charming position on the shore of a mountain
lake, are as near the perfect blend of detailed interest and
picturesque beauty as anything can be in this northern climate.
But they are not Ruskin's gardens. When the first glass-house
went up, he used to apologise for it to his visitors; it was to
please Mrs. Severn; it was to grow a few grapes for his
friends; he did not believe in hot-houses: and he would take
you up the steps he had contrived at the back of the house
and point out the tiny wild growths in their crannies, as he led
the way to his own private plot.</p>

<p>Sir Edwin Arnold, in a pleasant essay on Japanese rock-gardens,
quoting Ruskin on the beauty of stones, wonders
whether he would not have sympathised in these quaint tastes
of the Far East. Ruskin had little to say in praise of Japanese
art as he knew it, because they could not draw pretty figures,
and he had no admiration for dwarfs or monsters; but one
cannot help thinking that if he had seen Japan, and if it is all
that travellers tell us, he might have written some enthusiastic
passages on a people who love stones for their own sake and
tub themselves daily. To him, his rock gardens were a joy
for ever; and in his working years he set an example of Lake-district
landscape-gardening which still, for all I know, remains
unfollowed, and is worth a few paragraphs of record. You
can see little of it now. During that last decade, when he
wandered about his small domain like the ghost of his former
self, no one could carry on his work. The paths he made and
tended gradually became overgrown, the rocky watercourses
were choked with stones, his private plot filled with weeds, for
he could no longer dig in it; and now you can only trace
what it has been in the little solitude left sacred to memory.</p>

<p>THE WATERFALL AT BRANTWOOD DOOR. <span class="smcap">By L. J. Hilliard</span>, 1885</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was in the heart of the wood, approached by the steps
and winding path&mdash;not gravelled, but true woodland track.
About as large as a cottager's kitchen-garden, it was fenced on
two sides with a wooden paling, and an old stone wall, mossy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and ivied, kept off the trees and their undergrowth on the
higher side, up the hill. The trees, when he came, were the
coppice of the country, oak and hazel, periodically cut down
to the stubs, and used for turning bobbins and burning charcoal.
This clearance is always a sad thing for the moment, when the
leafy thicket is rased away, leaving bare earth and hacked
stumps and the toppings strewn about to rot into soil; but
next spring there are sure to be galaxies of primroses, if not
daffodils and bluebells to follow, and foxgloves as the summer
goes on; and so the kindness of nature heals the wound.
Next year there are shoots from the stubs, a miniature forest
which might even attract a Japanese; and as the saplings grow
the flowers thin out, until in two or three seasons the children
wonder why there are no primroses in the primrose-wood, and
cannot believe they are gone to sleep for ten years. In the
plantations of larch and timber trees the great bracken takes
the place of this aftergrowth of flowerets, shooting up six or
eight feet high where a clearing gives it a chance, and then
again dwindles as the trees regain their strength, until under a
well-grown larchwood there is nothing but a soft, deep, tressy
grass, not rank and full tinted like the sward of the meadows,
but grey-green and delicate and dry, though so thick and rich
that there is no easier couch for a woodland dreamer.</p>

<p>When Ruskin came to Brantwood he would have his
coppice cut no more. He let it grow, only taking off the
weaker shoots and dead wood. It spindled up to great tall
stems, slender and sinuous, promising no timber, and past
the age for all commercial use or time-honoured wont.
Neighbours shook their heads, but they did not know the
pictures of Botticelli, and Ruskin had made his coppice into
an early Italian altar-piece. Among those slender-pillared
aisles you would not be surprised to see goddesses appear
out of the green depths; and looking westward, the sun-dazzle
of the lake and the dark blue of the mountains
gazed in between the leaves. It was what the old Venetians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had seen in landward holidays and tried to remember for their
backgrounds. That in itself was one form of Ruskin's
gardening. To keep his forest at this delightful point of
mystery, his billhook and gloves were always lying on the hall
table, and after the morning's writing he would go up to the
Brant (steep) Wood and chop for half an hour before luncheon.
It was not the heroic axe-work of Mr. Gladstone, but such
pruning as a Garden of Eden required to dress it and to keep it.</p>

<p>Then in that private plot he had his espalier of apples and
a little gooseberry patch and a few standard fruit-trees and
some strawberries, mixed with flowers. In one corner there
were beehives in the old-fashioned penthouse, trailed over with
creepers. The fourth side was unfenced, but parted from the wood
by a deep and steep watercourse, a succession of cascades (unless
the weather were dry, which is not often the case at Coniston)
over hard slate rock. He used sometimes humorously to
complain of the trouble it cost him to keep the beck clear of
stones, and he could deduce you many a lesson in geology on
the way his rivulet filled, rather than deepened, its bed.</p>

<p>It was crossed by a rough wooden bridge. I remember at
the building of this bridge he was considerably annoyed because
the workman, thinking to please him with unusually rude lines,
had made the planks so flimsy that it was hardly safe. He
insisted on solidity and security, though his stone steps were
so irregular as to contradict all the rules which bid you make
stairs in a flight equal, for fear of tripping your passenger.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S RESERVOIR, BRANTWOOD</p></div>
</div>

<p>Over the bridge and within the wood there were frequent
hummocks and bosses of rock pushing through the soil, and
each with its special interest of fern or flower. Many a visitor
must have recalled or repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who loved the little rock, and set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon its head the coronet?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>while Ruskin led the way, pointing out each trail of ivy (convolvulus
not allowed for fear of strangling the stems) and nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of moss, as a gardener of the other species might point out
his orchids. Then suddenly forth of the wood you came upon
the tennis-lawn&mdash;another concession to youthful visitors, for
he played no athletic games. But in the creation of this glade
he took the keenest delight, believing, as he said, in diggings
of all sorts. He was the engineer, and the work was done in
great part by the young people who were to play tennis on
the ground when it was levelled&mdash;a rather distant hope, but
eventually fulfilled. The tall, thin saplings have run up higher
and higher all round the green: on one side you look through
their veil to the long expanse of lake; on the other, up the
dark, wooded hill; and on a sunny afternoon it has a curious
touch of poetry. There is no statue on a pedestal or fountain
playing in a basin, but on the mossy bank, beneath the
graceful lines of virginal forestry, Decamerons might have
been told. It is an oasis in the North-country farmer's
neighbourhood, this Lake district which the tripper thinks
just "country" as God made it, quoting Cowper, and not
dreaming of the "native's" view that the land is an unroofed
mutton-factory, with every inch of it "proputty, proputty,
proputty."</p>

<p>I do not mean to imply that Ruskin's gardening was
wilfully anti-utilitarian. The charm of it was that it brought
the natural advantages and local usages into a new light, with
just the refinement of feeling which made a flight of steps into
a rock-garden and a tennis-ground into a Purist painter's glade.
Who but he would have planted his field with narcissus, scattered
thinly among the grass, to surprise you with a reminiscence
of Vevey? And in the old garden below, though he did not
create it, you can trace his feeling in the terraced zigzag of
paths, hedged with apple and the cotoneaster which flourishes
at Coniston, and filled in with sloping patches of strawberry
and gooseberry. The average proprietor would have levelled
his walks and capped his dwarf walls with flat slabs. This
irregularity and cottage-garden business would have offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
those new-comers who buy a bit of nature at the Lakes and
improve away all its beauties.</p>

<p>It was in the late 'seventies, when the first illness had forced
him to spend most of his time at Brantwood, and in the early
'eighties, before final illness put an end to his activity, that
Ruskin, having completed his woodland paths and gardens, and
all the "diggings" at his harbour, went higher up the hill for
new worlds to conquer. His bit of moor above the wood was
opened out into a new sort of garden, quite as charming in its
way as any other. It was a steep patch of hillside grandly
overlooking the lake, with a foreground of foliage below and a
background of mountains above; but as Nature left it&mdash;or
rather as Nature made it after the original wild growth of oak
and birch and holly had been cleared away by the charcoal-burners
and sheep-farmers of past centuries. Strongly marked
ridges of slate-rock cropped out slantwise, across and across
the slope, their backs tufted over with heather and juniper, and
their hollows holding water in sodden quagmires. Down the
slope, from the bogs of the great moor behind, rising to a
thousand feet above the sea in some places, there were two
little streamlets which leapt the ridges and pooled in the
hollows among ferns and mosses. All the green fields and
farms of the dalesmen were once made out of such ground,
and many of them at quite as great a height; indeed the
actual elevation of this plot nowhere reaches five hundred feet.
The problem was to take advantage of whatever useful features
the site afforded without destroying its native charm. To
drain and clear an intake and put it under grass, or to plant it
outright, had been done before; but that was to do away with
the moorland character altogether. Just as a portrait-painter
studies to pose his sitter in such a light and in such an
attitude as to bring out the most individual points and get the
revelation of a personality, so Ruskin studied his moor, to
develop its resources.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S MOORLAND GARDEN</p></div>
</div>

<p>First, there were the streams; and his old theory of saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the water suggested impounding the trickle in a series of
reservoirs; it might be useful in case of drought or fire. So
we were marshalled with pick and spade every fair afternoon
to the "Board of Works," as we called it; and the old game
of the Hinksey diggings was played over again. For what
reason I never clearly understood, juniper was condemned on
the moor as convolvulus in the wood: and every savin-bush,
as it is called in the district, was to be uprooted, while the
heather was treasured, in spite of the farmers' rule to burn the
heather off, now and then, for the sake of the grass which
grows, for a while, in its place. Ruskin always regretted these
heather fires, for they do not really make good grass-land,
while they ruin the natural garden of ling and bell-heather.</p>

<p>When the basins were formed he found to his regret that
no mere earthen bank would hold the water; and skilled labour
had to be called in to build dams of stone and cement, less
pretty than the concealed dyke he had intended. But there
was some consolation in devising sluices and clever gates with
long lever handles, artistically curved, to shut and open the
slit. One would have thought, sometimes, to see his eagerness
over these inventions, that he had missed his vocation; and he
had indeed a keen admiration for the civil engineer, wherever
the road and bridge, mine and harbour, did not come into open
conflict with natural beauties which he thought just as essential
to human life as the material advantages of business. And
when his reservoirs were made, it was a favourite entertainment
to send up somebody to turn the water on and produce a
roaring cascade among the laurels opposite the front door.</p>

<p>Next, to illustrate his theory of reclaiming wastes, he set
about his moorland garden. At the upper corner of this
beck-course there was one ragged bit of ground against the
fence wall. From the more rocky parts we were set to carry
the soil to make terraces, which we walled up with the rough
stones found in plenty under the surface. One wetter patch
was planted with cranberries, and some apple- and cherry-trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were put in, where the soil was deep and drainage provided.
No wall or wire parted this little space of tillage from the
wilder moor and its rabbits, for the design was to enlarge the
cultivated area and make the moor a paradise of terraces like
the top of the purgatorial mount in Dante; and since this
fragment of an experiment was completed, when strength no
longer allowed him to stride up to this once favourite height,
the whole has been left to Nature again. The apple-trees
grew, but untended; they still blossom. The cherries have
run wild and are left to the birds. The rough steps from the
rock-platform to the orchard terrace are disjointed, and fern is
creeping through the grass.</p>

<p>as it did in those old Brantwood days when we picked and
shovelled together, first unearthing its miniature ravine; and
as perhaps it may&mdash;for no one can foretell the fate of any
sacred spot&mdash;when the pilgrim of the future tries to identify
by its help alone the whereabouts of Ruskin's deserted garden.</p>

RUSKIN'S OLD ROAD</p>

<p class="inno">In the Life of Ruskin three pages are given to his tour abroad
in 1882, a journey of importance to him, because at a critical
moment it gave him a new lease of life, and of unusual interest
to his biographer, who accompanied him as secretary, which is
to say "man-jack-of-all-trades." In such companionship much
personality comes out; and the gossip of this period, at greater
length than the proportions of a biography allowed, may help
to fill in some of the details of his portrait.</p>

<p>Very much broken down in health, despairing of himself
and his mission, he left London on Thursday, August 10,
1882. Calais Tower roused none of the old enthusiasm; he
said rather bitterly, "I wonder how I came to write about it."
But even in his depression the habit of work made him sketch
once more the tracery of the H√¥tel de Ville. He found out
the trick of its geometrical pattern, and explained it, delighted.
Then the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> at the H√¥tel Dessein was still in the flesh, and
remembered former visits and sent up a capital dinner; so the
first day on foreign soil augured hopefully.</p>

<p>On the Saturday he woke up to sunshine at Laon, and
took me round the town, setting me to work on various
points. He began a drawing of the cathedral front, which he
finished on the Monday before leaving. It was always rather
wonderful how he would make use of every moment, even
when ill-health and the fatigue of travelling might seem a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
reason for idling. At once on arriving anywhere he was ready
to sketch, and up to the minute of departure he went on with
his drawing unperturbed. In the afternoons he usually dropped
the harder work of the morning, and went for a ramble out
into the country; at Laon the hayfields and pear orchards
south of the town gave him, it seemed, just as much pleasure
as Chamouni.</p>

<p>Reims bored him; the cathedral he called confectioner's
Gothic, and he could not get rid of the idea of champagne and
all the vanities and vulgarities which hang on to the very word.
There was an ugly prison, too, put up next the cathedral; and
even St. Remi did not make amends. So he hastened on to
Troyes, spending a few hours between trains at Ch√¢lons, where
we "did" the town in the regular tourist fashion, finding,
however, beautiful features of early Gothic at N√¥tre Dame
and the Madeleine.</p>

<p>At Troyes he spent the 17th, sketching hard at St. Urbain
and the cathedral, and next morning reached Sens, a place loved
of old for associations with parents and friends, and not less for
its little gutter-brooks in the streets, which he pointed out with
a sort of boyish glee. The afternoon walk in the valley of the
Yonne and up the chalk hills brought much talk of the geology
of flints and the especial charm of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coteau</i> scenery, which he
said had never been cared for until Turner saw it and glorified
this comparatively humble aspect of mountains in the "Rivers
of France." He set me to draw the defaced statues on the
porch of the cathedral, the "finest north of Alps" he declared;
but we were getting on rather too fast, and he began to feel
the reaction of fatigue. The weather was sultry, and on the
19th our journey to Avallon was followed by distant thunder-storms.</p>

<p>At Avallon he stayed till the end of the month. The
place was new to him, but I think he was attracted to it by one
of those obscure associations which so often ran in his mind&mdash;it
must be interesting because it was named Avallon&mdash;Avalon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he called it always, dominated by the idea of the island-valley
of repose where King Arthur found the immortality of
fairyland. The first morning's work at the early church of
St. Ladre, and the first afternoon's walk down the valley of the
Cousin, with brilliant ling in blossom among bold red granite
rocks, fully justified his choice. The town, on its Durham-like
hill, swept round by the deep river-course, and unspoilt
by modernisms, and the wooded, flowery, rocky neighbourhood,
full of all that is most charming in French scenery&mdash;there are
Roman remains, too, but of these he took less note&mdash;and the
curious details of the twelfth-century church all attracted him
mightily. The only drawback was the weather, which broke
down with the thunder and gave us cold east winds and dark
haze, in which sketching was a penance. This told upon him
at once; he even dined alone, wearied out of evenings, and
still trying to fix his mind on the writing work he always took
with him&mdash;in this instance the new edition of "Sesame and
Lilies" and the "Bible of Amiens." He burned the candle
at both ends; out early to draw elusive detail of battered
sculptures, walking far in the afternoon, and writing hard at
night, impatient of remonstrance even from those who were
much better qualified to order him about than a secretary.</p>

<p>To meet him here came Mr. Frank Randal, who was
employed on drawings for "St. George's Work," and making
bright, sunny sketches in which the neatest of outline was
reconciled with the freshest of colouring. Also came his friend,
Mr. Maundrell, to whom I take this chance of offering an
apology which makes me blush to record. Among Ruskin's
drawings was one, much in his Proutesque style, of a chapel at
Rue, near Abbeville. It had been passed as his, when Mrs.
Severn went through the portfolios with him, noting the subjects
on the back of the mounts; and&mdash;with some hesitation, I
confess, and neglect of the good rule "When in doubt, don't"&mdash;it
was shown at both Ruskin Exhibitions as a work by the
master, and greatly admired. Too late for correction, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
found to be Mr. Maundrell's. Others have nearly caught
Ruskin's style at times&mdash;"Bunney's, not mine," he has written
on sketches by an assistant, for this very reason; but for
all the more important drawings there is a good pedigree, and
most of the smaller bits which have been shown or published
have come from his sketch-books.</p>

<p>One good excursion from Avallon was to the church of
V√©zelay, the twelfth-century place elaborately restored by
Viollet-le-Duc, and interesting for the meeting of Richard
C≈ìur-de-Lion with the other leaders of the Crusade famous in
"Ivanhoe" and "The Talisman." To Ruskin any restoration
meant ruin; but as he went round the aisles, disdainful at first
but gradually warming to the intelligence and skill of the great
modern architect, he confessed that if restoration might be
done at all it could not be better done. What pleased him
much more was a hunt, on the way back, for the exact spot
where the Avallon granite joined the limestone; he found the
two rocks side by side in a hummock near the road, and was
triumphant.</p>

<p>Montr√©al was another place of pilgrimage, and there the
church with quaint wood-carvings and the picturesque village
gave him a happy day. In his diary (on which see the next
chapter) he scolded himself, after this excursion, for forgetting
the good times; of a walk in the rain to the little oratory of
St. Jean des Bons Hommes he said: "I ought to vignette it
for a title to my books!" and of the Avallon neighbourhood
he notes: "Altogether lovely, and like Dovedale and the
Meuse and the glens of Fribourg in all that each has of best,
and like Chamouni in granite cleavage, and like&mdash;itself, in
sweet French looks and ways.... The miraculous fairy
valley  ... one of the sweetest ever made by heaven. The
Cyclopean walls, of blocks seven and eight feet long, and three
feet thick&mdash;the largest&mdash;all averaging two and a half (feet)
cube, at a guess, laid with their smooth cleavages to the outside,
fitted like mosaic&mdash;the chinks filled with smaller stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
altogether peculiar to this district of cleaving, and little twisting,
granite." It was not only the scenery that he cared for, but
the evidences of happy pastoral life, adapting Nature's gifts to
human needs. But when, off the kindly granite and on the
cold, grey limestone country, we passed a forlorn homestead,
ruinous and dirty, he shrank back in the carriage, as if some
one had thrown a stone at him.</p>

<p>On the last day of August he left Avallon, and with a
short stay at S√©mur reached his old quarters at the H√¥tel de la
Cloche, Dijon. He was already contemplating "Pr√¶terita,"
picking up the memories of early days, and planning a drive by
the old road through Jura as his parents used to do it in the
pre-railway period. He began by showing me where he bit
his "Seven Lamps" plate in the wash-hand basin, and where
Nurse Anne used to wake him of mornings. Meanwhile, for
the book to be called "Our Fathers have told us," continuing
"The Bible of Amiens," he would spend two days with the
monks. C√Æteaux, the home of the Cistercians, was the first
day's trip, marred by the heat and dust, and by finding all
vestiges of the monks replaced by an industrial school of the
ugliest, which, nevertheless, he inspected with nicely restrained
impatience. A moated grange on the wayside homeward
caught his eye, and as he sketched it he tried to make me
believe that this must at least be a bit of the monks' work, and
the journey not in vain. But next day there were far more
interesting experiences in a visit to St. Bernard's birthplace.
He has described this fully in his lecture called "Mending the
Sieve," in the volume of "Verona, &amp;c.," and I need only
recall the surprise of a bystander not wholly unsympathetic,
when Ruskin knelt down on the spot of the great saint's
nativity, and stayed long in prayer. He was little given to
outward show of piety, and his talk, though enthusiastic, had
been no preparation for this burst of intense feeling.</p>

<p>Later on the same day (Saturday, September 2) he left
Dijon for the Jura drive. We passed Poligny, a usual resting-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in bygone journeys, by train, and stayed at Champagnole,
where the old H√¥tel de la Poste used to be one of his "homes."
It had been splendid weather for the last few days, after a cold
August in Central France; and the first Jura walk was across
the hill to the gorge of the Ain. I had often been through the
Jura, as a blind, benighted modern, but never before loitered
from slab to slab of its fissured limestone summits, looking for
the foreground loveliness of nestling flowers which contrast so
delicately with the quaint, crannied rock; there is nothing
which gives the same lyrical feeling except some of Nature's
gardens in wild Icelandic lava-fields. How eager he was, and
delighted with this open upland! You know there is only
one place where he speaks of "liberty" as a good thing, and
there it means the liberty of this Jura walk, enjoyed that
afternoon.</p>

<p>By-and-by we came to a wood. He cast about a little for
the way through the trees, then bade me notice that the flowers
of spring were gone: "You ought to have seen the wood-anemones,
and oxalis, and violets"; and then, picking his steps
to find the exact spot by a twisted larch-tree, and gripping my
arm to hold me back on the brink of the abyss, "That's where
the hawk sailed off the crag, in one of my old books; do you
remember?"</p>

<p>There were thunder clouds over the plain-country that
evening, and we made no stop to sketch. On our drive next
day up to the flat, high country of St. Laurent, with its pine
forests and scattered cottages, and down into Morez, the
weather worsened. Thence the road climbs by the side of the
valley to the highest back of Jura at Les Rousses; the road, he
says, "walked most of the way, was mere enchantment." At
a halt I sketched, when a break in the clouds gave sunbeams
darting into the valley beneath, and wisps of white wreathed the
steep forests. You see where he got that beautiful cadence to
a fine passage, after comparing the Jura upland with a Yorkshire
moor, and contrasting the becks of our fells with the enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
silence of open Jura. "The raincloud clasps her cliffs, and
floats along her fields; it passes, and in an hour the rocks are
dry, and only beads of dew left in the Alchemilla leaves&mdash;but
of rivulet or brook, no vestige, yesterday or to-day or to-morrow.
Through unseen fissures and filmy crannies the waters of cliff
and plain have alike vanished; only far down in the depth of
the main valley glides the strong river, unconscious of
change."</p>

<p>Up at Les Rousses he pointed out the fort, then in building
or newly built, with scorn&mdash;as if the Swiss on the one side or the
French on the other could be kept in their bounds by stone
walls, when real war comes; and then crossing the frontier
there was the elation of getting into Switzerland. "Why do
you like it better than France?" he asked. I was just trying
to say why, that it is a free country and some more innocent
gush, when the Swiss Customs officers ran up, and insisted on
overhauling us, for they don't often see travellers as in the old
days at Les Rousses. I was mightily crestfallen and he not a
little delighted at this exemplification of "liberty"; but he did
not make the incident a horrid example in "Pr√¶terita."</p>

<p>Here we diverged a little from the old road of his youth, by
going east a few miles to St. Cergues instead of making for the
Col de la Faucille at once. The clean inn delighted him; pine
boards on the floor, scrubbed white, and no needless furniture.
Here he said we should stay a week and rest; he had much to
write&mdash;first ideas for "Pr√¶terita," you understand. But the next
days were wet, and he sat in his bedroom writing diligently at
first, while I caught some bright intervals for a sketch, though
we never saw the line of the Alps quite clear.</p>

<p>In the lecture on "the Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth
Century," one of his least convincing though most sincerely
meant utterances, there are references to the strange weather of
those days. All the way up from Morez he wanted me to
come into the carriage and shut the window because of a
treacherous east wind, and in my sketch you can see a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
smoky, not only thundery, look in the clouds. At St. Cergues
this east wind haze was still more pronounced, the Lake of
Geneva ruffled and white, with patches of shadow from small
"sailor-boy" clouds, while the whole range opposite was not
exactly shrouded but veiled in a persistent thickness of air.
Above, the sky was bright, with blue and streaky cirrus, and
between the showers the sun glittered on the trees. That fitful
wind with the brownish-grey haze he called the plague-wind,
and in all his lecture there is no very definite explanation of it,
but much declamation against it as the ruin of landscape, and
some vague hints of portent, almost as if he had been a
prophet of old seeing the burden of modern Babylon in the
darkened sun.</p>

<p>It is smoke. Any one who haunts our Lake district hills
knows it well. On coronation night I saw it trailing from
Barrow and Carnforth up the Lune valley as far as Tebay,
always low and level, leaving the upper hills clear, perfectly
continuous and distinct from the mist of water. This winter,
from the top of Wetherlam on a brilliant frosty day, I saw it
gradually invade the Lake district from the south-east; the
horizontal, clean-cut, upper surface at about 2000 feet; the
body of it dun and semi-transparent; its thick veil fouling the
little cotton-woolly clouds that nestled in the coves of the
Kirkstone group, quite separate from the smoke-pall; and by
sunset it had reached to Dungeon Gill, leaving the Bow Fell
valleys clear. Coming down by moonlight I found the dales
in a dry, cold fog, and heard that there had been no sunshine
at Coniston that afternoon. This is Ruskin's plague-cloud,
and the real enemy of the weather not only in England but in
the Alps. You will see it, according to the wind, on either
side of Zurich most notably, and the distance this blight will
travel is more than the casual reader might believe. A strong
wind carries it away, but only to deposit it somewhere else,
cutting off the sun's rays, and breeding rain and storm. This
was not understood twenty years ago, but Ruskin's observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the weather were perfectly accurate and his regrets at the
changed aspect of Alpine landscape were only too justifiable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">September 1882</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>On Thursday, September 7, he had tired of dull weather at
St. Cergues, and written up his notes for "Pr√¶terita"; he
proposed to climb the D√¥le and get onward to Geneva. It is a
very easy walk of about a couple of hours up the gently sloping
backs of the Helvellyn-like Jura range; and from its top one
should get a grand view of the lake and the Alps to Mont
Blanc. He walked up as briskly as ever; there was a cold wind
but sun overhead, though the mountains to the south and east
were still in the "plague-cloud." There was no sketching to
be done, and we followed the ridge down to the Col de la
Faucille. If you look at his map of the Jura, facsimiled at
<a href="#Page_109">page 109</a> of this volume, the Col is where the road suddenly
turns round into zigzags after going straight south-west behind
the D√¥le; and you remember how he names the whole chapter
from this one spot, as a chief landmark in his memories, for
there he always used to get his first full view of the "Mount
Beloved." Few travellers know it, he says; but it is far from
unknown to all who have lived in la Suisse Romande. There,
they take school-children up mountains. Far better than
Helvellyn is known to the English school child, the "dear
D√¥le" is known to every youngster who has learnt to sing (to
the tune of "Life let us cherish") the song of</p>

<span class="i0">La Suisse est belle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh qu'il la faut ch√©rir!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We were not quite without our view. For a moment, too
short for a sketch, Mont Blanc loomed through the dull haze,
red in the sunset, brick red, not Alpine rose; and then all was
grey. We found our carriage and drove down. I was waked
in the darkness by Ruskin saying, "This is where Voltaire
lived." "Oh, indeed!" said I.</p>

<p>Next morning, from his old front rooms at the H√¥tel des
Bergues, where he had already begun a sketch of the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
opposite, merely for love of them, we went out in the heat to
see the Rh√¥ne. All the haze had gone, at least from the
nearer view, and he seemed never tired of looking at the water
from the footbridge and wherever it was visible. I wondered
why he would not come on; but now I know. "Fifteen feet
thick&mdash;of not flowing but flying water"&mdash;I will not quote the
wonderful pages which every lover of Ruskin, of landscape,
and of English undefiled, must know&mdash;the "one mighty wave
that was always itself, and every fluted swirl of it constant as
the wreathing of a shell"; and then the bit about its blue, and
"the innocent way" of it, and its dancing and rippling and
glittering, "and the dear old decrepit town as safe in the
embracing sweep of it as if it were set in a brooch of sapphire"&mdash;that
was what he was thinking, and storing up in his mind
the famous description which showed that even so late, in
shattered health and, as people said, impaired powers, he could
talk and write as brilliantly as ever.</p>

<p>That afternoon in the glaring sunshine we drove out of
Geneva through suburban villadom&mdash;he much amused at the
modern fashion of house-names, "Mon Repos," "Chez Nous,"
and so forth&mdash;towards Monnetier. He was at the moment
healthily interested in Alpine structure, the geology of scenery,
and could forget "St. George" in his eagerness to expound his
views on the cleavage of the Sal√®ve. I made a slight note of
the lines, the cathedral-like buttresses which flank the level-bedded
masonry of the great mountain-wall with masses of a
different rock, vertically cloven; and the gorge of Monnetier
which cuts the range across with an unexpected breach; and
we went over his old debate with the Genevese geologists.
Then we climbed the Echelle, and from the top found the
Annecy Alps fairly clear, but I think the same heaviness over
the greater snow-peaks. At last we reached Mornex, his old
home in the 'sixties, when he was writing "Munera Pulveris"
and first seriously grappling with the social problems which afterwards
became his chief theme in so many lectures and books.</p>

OF THE SAL√àVE</p></div>
</div>

<p>A letter he wrote that evening, to describe the visit, has
recently been published; how he found his old house a
restaurant, with people drinking on the terrace. He was,
though he did not say so, rather cast down by the change&mdash;he
who always deplored changes; but brightened when the landlord
guessed who he must be, and quite cheered up&mdash;with that
last infirmity of noble minds&mdash;on hearing that the English
sometimes came to see Ruskin's house. Indeed, it was more
his home than many a house in England where he spent longer
years, for it was of choice, not of necessity, that he lived there,
and would have continued there to his own great advantage but
for his father's death, which recalled him to the care of his
widowed mother.</p>

<p>One phrase in that letter as now printed seems to have
pained and alarmed some of his friends; but surely without
cause. He says to account for beginning his letter on the
wrong side of the paper&mdash;as most people seem to do nowadays&mdash;that
he had taken a glass too much Burgundy. The son of
the sherry-merchant, with old-fashioned notions on the fitness
of things, always took a glass or two of wine at dinner; one of
his sayings was, "A glass of good wine never hurt anybody."
But I am sure all his personal friends will bear me out that it
never went beyond the glass or two. He was no drinker, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his very strong anti-teetotal attitude was simply the expression
of his own habitual and easy temperance. That evening's
dinner I remember well. After our walk from Veyrier to Pont
d'Etrembi√®res, and more sauntering by the Rh√¥ne in a beautiful
red sunset, we came in late. At table we had some debate
about the pictures on the walls of the hotel sitting-room, and
he would not have it that Madame Vig√©e Lebrun's portrait of
herself and her daughter was charming. "No decent woman,"
he said, "would paint herself with bare arms, like that!"&mdash;which
was quite his usual way of thinking about a much-discussed
question of art. And then we settled to a little
after-dinner writing, and you will not be surprised if we both
nodded over our pens after that long hot day&mdash;<em>and</em>, of course,
the Burgundy.</p>

RUSKIN'S "CASHBOOK"</p>

<p class="inno">So it is lettered on the back; but his titles, as every one
knows, are far-fetched. There are some accounts in this
volume, but most of it is filled with a diary of the tour abroad
in 1882, and subsequent entries, very neatly written; the red
lines for ¬£ <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i> serving to keep the manuscript within margins,
just like print.</p>

<p>Ruskin's journals, I understand, are not to be published.
The bulk of their contents&mdash;landscape descriptions and various
notes on natural history, architecture, and many different subjects&mdash;have
been worked into his books. The remainder
consists of daily jottings about the weather, always important
to one whose chief pleasure was in scenery, with fragmentary
hints of his occupations or travels, and still more fragmentary
mention of persons. They are not exactly memoranda; still
less the memoirs of a literary man, written with one eye on
the public. They are mere soliloquies of the moment, gossip
of himself to himself before breakfast.</p>

<p>While he lived, though I had often occasion to refer to
these journals, I never felt quite at liberty to open this "Cashbook,"
with its private notes on a period when I was practically
alone with him; his valet, Baxter, was also of the party, but
at meals and at work, on walks and drives, he had usually to
put up with my company. He was exceedingly and unfailingly
kind, but exacting; it would have needed great self-confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to be sure of his good opinion. But now that these papers
require it, to paint his portrait as he was at that time, I have
taken advantage of Mrs. Severn's kind leave; and in continuing
the story of the tour I can sometimes add to my
reminiscences Ruskin's impressions on the spot as recorded by
himself.</p>

<p>From Geneva we went up to Sallenches (September 9,
1882), hoping to see the Alps, in spite of the smoke-cloud.
He was at the moment thinking and talking chiefly of "artistic
geology," if one may coin a parallel to "artistic anatomy"&mdash;the
old subject of his "Modern Painters," vol. iv. In the
chapter on the Old Road I said <em>healthily</em> interested, for any
work on Nature was good for him personally, and this tour
was for the sake of health after long and recurrent attacks of
illness.</p>

<p>In those days, and to the few who cared much more for
himself than his mission, St. George and St. Benedict were the
enemies; his Guild and all the worries connected with it, and
his ethico-socio-political meditations, mixed with much wandering
into Greek and medi√¶val mythology, always meant
mischief to him. So after the visit to C√Æteaux and the birthplace
of St. Bernard, it was good to see him eager for the
mountains, and looking out for well-known twists in the limestone
strata, and clefts and cascades, points of view and distant
glimpses, all the way up the valley. If only the smoke-cloud
would lift, and a spell of fair weather would tempt him to
linger among the Alps, hammering rocks and sketching
cottages, the object of the journey would be gained.</p>

<p>There was a horrid new road being made high up on the
flank of his favourite mountain, the Brezon, whose top he had
wanted to possess. At Cluses, what were those sticks in the
meadow? I asked; and learnt that they marked out the long-intended
railway. A railway in the valley of the Arve! It
meant to him simply the end of all that made the glory and
grandeur of this classic ground. But he was partly comforted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
by the thought that after all it might not be, or, at least, not in
his time. Maglans and the Nant d'Arpenaz were still as
Turner painted them; and though his old familiar resting-place
at St. Martin was no longer open as an inn, we could stay
across the valley at Sallenches, within easy walks of many
favourite haunts.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, which he usually spent more
quietly than other days. We took the walk his father and he
used to take on many Sundays passed in that neighbourhood,
up a glen to the south of the village. In his diary that day
he began an analysis of the Psalms&mdash;he had been taking them
for his morning Bible-readings; and I find that at St. Cergues,
on the 5th, he had thankfully noted the arrival of a telegram
with good news from home, just as he was reading me the
104th Psalm. He did not hold "family prayers" as a habit,
but sometimes when he was delighted with a nice chapter he
couldn't keep it to himself.</p>

<p>MONT BLANC CLEARING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sketched with Ruskin at Sallenches, September 1882</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Early next morning Mont Blanc was clear, though soon
clouded (the diary is quoted in the "Storm-cloud" lecture);
and then, in pursuance of the geology study he had begun
he set to work "to do a little Deucalion," but opened Job
instead, at xi. 16, and read on "with comfort" the "glorious
natural history" of the old book. Next day he noted the
second speech of Zophar as "the leading piece of political
economy" which he ought to have quoted in "Fors."</p>

<p>In spite of the dull weather we had a good ramble up the
valley he called "Norton's Glen," from the remembrance of
walks there with Professor Charles Eliot Norton; and though
sketching was little use, he was happy in the contemplation of
boulders. It was in coming down from that walk (if I
remember right; the diary does not mention it) that I got
such a scolding for proposing to extract a fossil from a stone
in a vineyard terrace-wall: "You bad boy! Have you no
respect for property?" or words to that effect; and I had to
leave the specimen <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>. But next day I "scored" with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
careful drawing of the Nant d'Arpenaz, disentangling the
contorted beds of limestone; and in the diary is a copy from
my sketch, a subject, he said, he had often tried in vain. On
the way back to Sallenches we looked at the old H√¥tel du
Mont Blanc at St. Martin, which gives a title to one of the
chapters of "Pr√¶terita," and need not be described here; but
he was so taken with it and its memories that he asked whether
it was for sale, and really formed a plan of buying it, and
coming to live there. The diary gives various reasons, ending
with one of the oddest; I had made some verses about the
place, rather on the lines his talk had suggested, but ending
with more optimism, and these, too, he notes, contributed to
the "leadings" which pointed him to a new home in Savoy.
A little later there came a letter addressed to "MM. Ruskin
et Collingwood"&mdash;"Quite like a firm," he said; "I wonder
what they think we're travelling in; but I hope we'll always
be partners"&mdash;the terms of the offer I forget, but they did not
seem practicable, or Coniston might have known him no more.</p>

<p>At least, it was possible, and it would have been good in
many ways for him; but there were ties to think of. Next
day, after rain in the valley and snow on the Varens, and
swallows gathering in crowds along the eaves and cornices of
the square, there was a grand clearance at sunset, and he wrote
to Miss Beever the note printed in "Hortus Inclusus" about
seeing Mont Blanc&mdash;"a sight which always redeems me to what
I am capable of at my poor little best, and to what loves and
memories are most precious to me. So I write to <em>you</em>, one of
the few true loves left. The snow has fallen fresh on the hills,
and it makes me feel that I must soon be seeking shelter at
Brantwood and the Thwaite." And yet he was greatly tempted
to stay. On the splendid morning which followed he wrote in
his journal, "Perfect light on the Dorons, and the Varens a
miracle of aerial majesty. I&mdash;happy in a more solemn way
than of old. Read a bit of Ezra and referred to Haggai ii. 9&mdash;'In
this place will I give peace.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Letters, however, were expected at Geneva, and with many
plans for Sixt and Chamouni he turned his back on Sallenches
for the time and had a "marvellous drive through the valley of
Cluse; C&mdash;&mdash; sectionising (making notes of limestone strata)
all the way. Divine walk to old spring under Brezon." Then
he reproves himself for his annoyance at the "plague-wind"
and tiresome letters at Geneva, "for I shall try to remember
the Aiguille de Bionassay of the 13th at evening and the Nant
d'Arpenaz looked back at yesterday morning&mdash;with my
morning walk once more among the dew above Sallenches&mdash;for
ever and a day."</p>

<p>Without keeping constantly before one's mind his passionate
love of scenery it is impossible to put a right estimate on much
that he has written. There are comparatively few people
whose chief pleasure is in taking a walk and looking at the
country, without any notion of sport or games to eke out the
interest. It is true that he sketched and wrote, but his
pleasure was in seeing. It was his admiration of Nature that
had brought him to admire Art in his youth, and I think it is
not too much to say that Art was always a secondary thing to
him personally. The desire to see Art healthily and nobly
practised made him study the life of the craftsman and the
craftsman's surroundings, spiritual and material. The material
needs of Victorian society pressed upon him "Unto this Last"
and "St. George"; the spiritual needs drove him back upon
ancient religious ideals, "The Queen of the Air" and "St.
Benedict." All these various strands of thought were closely
woven together in his life, but from the beginning to the end
the love for natural scenery was the core of the cable. You
gather already from this "Cashbook" that a few days among
the Alps had quite restored him to physical strength, and given
him hopes and happiness.</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 16, we left Geneva for Annecy,
intending more limestone geology, and thenceforward had many
days' driving with the "Mephistopheles coachman and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Black Dog," as he put it at first. Later on he became enthusiastic
over the same coachman for his capital driving and care
of his horses, and because of the story of the dog Tom,
whom, the man said, he had rescued from death at the hands
of an American owner at Nice. Tom, with his spiked fur
collar, was usually absent at the start. The driver said he was
shut up so that he might not annoy Messieurs; but he always
appeared, was scolded, and forgiven, and petted for the rest
of the way. Affection for animals appealed to Ruskin, and in
France one sees much of it. On one of these drives we
stopped for lunch out of doors before a wayside inn. To this
lunch there came a little dog, two cats, and a pet sheep, and
shared our wine, bread, and Savoy sponge-cakes. The sheep
at last got to putting its feet on the table, and the landlady
rushed out and carried him off in her arms into the house; but
Ruskin, I think, would quite as soon have let the creature
stay. At Annecy the landlord told me stories of his big St.
Bernard dog, how he was defended from other dogs by the cat,
and how sometimes they quarrelled, and then the dog had to go
and sit on the mat out of doors until the cat had forgiven him;
how the cat also was in the habit of catching swallows on the
wing, and bringing them in to show&mdash;as, certainly, cats do
with the mice they catch&mdash;and then she would let them go
uninjured. This delighted Ruskin at dinner, and may have
suggested the dream which I see he records in his "Cashbook"&mdash;"dreamt
of a fine old lion who was quite good if he wasn't
kept prisoner; but when I had got him out, I didn't know
what to do with him." The parting with Tom and his master
I have mentioned elsewhere&mdash;how he gave the man twenty
francs for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne main</i> and two francs over for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne patte</i>, he
said, to the dog!</p>

<p>At Annecy, in the pleasant H√¥tel Verdun, he confessed
himself already stronger, and fit for anything but proofs and
business letters; but the "plague-cloud" still hung over the
view. He noted that the smoke from the factory chimneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
could not be told from the clouds except by its density, and
mixed with the mist so as to throw a pall over the lake
from the town to the Tournette&mdash;the great mountain of the
neighbourhood above Talloires. But still he did not see that
the black, ragged, dirty weather was caused by the smoke,
though he compared it with a London November. The nearer
scenery was visible and beautiful. The blue lake, always blue,
with a light of its own, and Talloires, with pleasant associations
and unspoiled surroundings of most romantic character, charmed
him as of old. We drove there the first Sunday; he took me
up to Eug√®ne Sue's house and then on to the cascade, two and
a half hours' walk, and then sauntered among the vineyards
and along the bay, under the plane-tree avenues, driving home
in an open carriage, and said he had not spent such an idle day
for ten years. Next day we "did" the Gorge of the Fier, and
discussed the possible causes of this great ravine, through which
the river plunges so unexpectedly and, one would think, unnecessarily.
Then to Talloires again, and planned return for work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had made appointments in Italy. He talked
of a rush to Rome and hasty visits to Lucca and Florence,
coming back soon to the Alps. But this turned out to be a
longer journey than he had meant. His seal-motto was
"To-day," and the business of the moment was always the
most important with him; and so the Italian tour was prolonged
to nearly two months. It ended in his catching a
thorough cold at Pisa through sketching in November winds,
and in his longing for the clear air of the Alps again, before
returning to London for the lecture he had promised to give in
December. This was the lecture announced as "Crystallography,"
but delivered as "Cistercian Architecture," about
which he said, joking at his own expense, that it would probably
have come to much the same thing whatever the title
had been. I did not quite see why he should lecture on either;
but he declared himself quite well, and as we had dropped
crystallography&mdash;the chief subject before the tour&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
cathedrals and abbeys in Italy, he shut himself up at Pisa, cold
and all, to write his lecture. Then having, as he thought,
mastered it, we ran north. He wanted to stay at St. Michel,
a favourite place on the Mont Cenis line, but high, and likely
to be bleak in November for a man with a bad cold, I thought&mdash;very
possibly mistaken. I took tickets for Aix-les-Bains,
and we had our only quarrel on that trip. I felt particularly
guilty as he recounted to me, in an injured tone, the horrors
of Aix, the one place he abominated, and the beauties of St.
Michel, while the train climbed the Dora valley to Bardonecchia
in fairly fine weather.</p>

<p>On the French side it was deep snow and bitter weather
as we ran down to Aix. The next day was delightful, but I
always shirked the recollection of my misdemeanour until I
found how his diary-entries ignored it. "The cold's quite
gone! Friday in glowing sunshine, Pisa to Turin; Saturday
in frightful damp and cold, Turin to Aix; but quite easy days
both. Sun coming out now. Dent de Bourget over mist and
low cloud, very lovely, as I dressed."</p>

<p>The next entry I copy because it shows that he was not as
entirely hostile to railways as the casual reader imagines.
Writing of the ride to Annecy he says in the "Cashbook":
"An entirely divine railway-<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup√©</i> drive from Aix by the river
gorges; one enchantment of golden trees and ruby hills." But
it was a splendid day. In clumsier phrasing I wrote home of
"all the prettiest autumn colours that ever were made out of
remnants of old rainbows patched up into a gala dress for the
world."</p>

<p>A SAVOY TOWN IN SNOW</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Annecy we delayed only long enough for me to get
rooms in the H√¥tel de l'Abbaye at Talloires, where we stayed
from the 14th to the 22nd in stormy, snowy weather. He
was quite well at first, and proud of leading the way down the
steep mountain-tracks&mdash;well known to him&mdash;in the dark after
long walks; but some days we could not get out at all. I sat
writing by the log fire in the dining-room; he preferring his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
bedroom, with what glimpses could be got of the lake through
snowstorms; and in the night the wind howled through
deserted corridors&mdash;for the place was once a real monastery&mdash;until
it became quite uncanny. His bad dreams had gone, but
he could not get exercise enough to sleep well. The lecture
was variously rewritten, monks and myths chasing one another
through his brain, instead of the crystal-cleavages and rock-forms
he had set out to study. St. Benedict had been too
strong for us, and the ghost of St. Bernard of Talloires (or of
Menthon, not the St. Bernard of his former pilgrimage, but a
tenth-century hermit, whose cave is still shown) who saw "not
the Lake of Annecy, but the dead between Martigny and
Aosta," and founded the hospice that bears his name&mdash;as
Ruskin would fain have founded, in another way, a refuge for
those who fall in the nineteenth-century struggle for life; but
fell himself in attempting it.</p>

<p>I did not know at the time that he was meditating a return
to his Professorship at Oxford. He kept that a secret, and sent
me off on a special mission to draw Alps in snow. Rejoining
him at Geneva I found him in the depths of misery, with the
weather bad and his work going too slowly forward, and the
glamour all gone out of his "mother town" of Geneva, "or
what was once Geneva," he said, ruined by touristry and luxury
into a mere suburb of Paris, which was a suburb of hell. So
through cold and flooded France he took his way homeward.
At Paris, H√¥tel Meurice was no longer what it had been; the
pneumatic clock in his room, with its minute-gun of a tick and
a jerk, got on his nerves, and he demanded of the bewildered
waiter that it should be stopped. The Tuileries were in ruins,
placarded for sale as building material. In the bookshops he
could not buy the books he sought, but, as it seemed, only
photographs of actresses. The Louvre, even, in such surroundings
gave him only suggestions of irritation. And it
was a thankful secretary who saw him safely over the Channel
and back to Herne Hill on the first Saturday in December.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>But the journey was not a failure. At Lucca he made
some of his best drawings, and the descriptive passages in
"Pr√¶terita" and elsewhere, written on that tour, or from
notes then made, are among his finest; and he was able to
write in his "Cashbook" on December 3: "Slept well, and
hope to be fit for lecture to-morrow; very happy in showing
our drawings and complete sense of rest after three months'
tossing." Early in the next year he found himself able to take
up his old work at Oxford, and for awhile&mdash;but only for awhile&mdash;it
seemed that the storm-cloud of his life had cleared away.</p>

<p class="chap">VI<br />
RUSKIN'S ILARIA</p>

<p class="inno">On Friday, September 22, 1882, we were at Turin. "Filthy
city," Ruskin wrote in his diary. "One pestilence now of
noise and smoke; and I got fearfully sad and discouraged, not
only by this, but by not caring the least any more for my old
pets of pictures, and not being able to see the minerals in close,
dark rooms." But he adds, "Note the unique white
amianth," and so forth, and he seemed to know the collection
by heart. As to the pictures, the way he pointed out how
Vandyck <em>enjoyed</em> the laying on of his colour, in a portrait of
King Charles, gloating over the horse's mane and the delicate
dexterity of the armour, makes me hope that even the steam
tramways of Turin had not utterly darkened his life.</p>

<p>Once out of the town his spirits rose. "Alps clear, within
twenty or thirty miles of Monte Viso; then through sandhills
of Br√† to Montenotte, down among the strange mounds and
dells of the Apennine gneiss, to Savona walled down to the sea,
beside a dismantled fortress which is certainly one of Turner's
late subjects. Then among the olives and palms, and by the
green serpentines, under darkening clouds, with constant
boom and sigh of waves, to Cogoleto." But at Genoa the
Sunday was "a day of disgust at all things. Proud palaces,
foolish little St. Georges over their doors. Duomo in my pet
style, not doing it credit; and a long climb over rocks, and
road of black limestone veined with white, commanding all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
heaps, rather than hills, of the mouldering earth, looking
almost barren in its dull grass, on which the suburbs of Genoa,
hamlet and villa, are scattered far and wide; the vast new
cemetery, their principal object of view and glorification, seen
by the winding of the waterless river-bed."</p>

<p>To most of us there is nothing more exhilarating than the
platform-shout when the south express starts&mdash;"Parrr&mdash;tenza
per Spezia&mdash;Pisa&mdash;Livorno&mdash;Firenze&mdash;Civitavecchia&mdash;Roooma!"
and the clattering dash through tunnel after
tunnel, among the rocks and green breakers of that wonderful
coast. But it only worried and unnerved him. It was not
his old road.</p>

<p>It was dull weather at Pisa after the first dewy morning for
the Campo Santo; and there were "entirely diabolical" trams
and chimneys in the town since his last visit. The streets,
every reach of them loved of old for some jewel of mellowed
architecture, were changing with modern progress. The town
was noisier and dirtier than in days of yore. He had come to
meet Nicola Pisano and company; but the ghosts wouldn't
rise. "Penny whistles from the railroad perpetual, and view
of town from river totally destroyed by iron pedestrian bridge.
Lay awake very sad from one to half-past four, but when I
sleep my dreams are now almost always pleasant, often very
rational. A really rather beautiful one of consoling an idiot
youth who had been driven fierce, and making him gentle,
might be a lesson about Italy. But what is Italy without her
sky&mdash;or her religion?" So he broke off work in the Baptistery
on Michaelmas Day at noon, and ordered the carriage for
Lucca.</p>

<p>THE PALACE OF PAOLO GUINIGI, LUCCA</p></div>
</div>

<p>Every one knows the route; over the Maremma, between
the sea and the mountains. Peaks of Carrara clouded to the
north; ruins of Ripafratta frowning over the crags; "vines,
olives, precipices." At last you see a neat little town, boxed
up in four neat walls, with rows of trees on the ramparts and
towers looking over the trees; it is just like the medi√¶val<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
town in the background of a triptych. Silk-mills there are,
but not in evidence&mdash;at least, so it was twenty years ago.</p>

<p>As we drove up to the gate that afternoon the Customs
officers turned out, and we laughed when the coachman shouted:
"English family! Nothing to declare!" and the officers
bowed, unquestioning. "So much nicer, isn't it?" said
Ruskin, "than being bundled about among trucks and all the
hideous things they heap round railway stations"; and in a
few minutes we were in front of the Hotel Royal of the
Universe. Signor Ruskino was expected; family and servants
were at the door; everybody shook hands. The cook was
busy with the dinner, I think; for when we had seen our
rooms&mdash;he took the plainest of the tall, partitioned suite
with rococo decorations, palatial but tarnished&mdash;"First," he
said, "I must go and see the cook"; and so away to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>He was patient of life's little worries; but he liked a good
dinner when it was there. I remember the serviette full of
crumbly chestnuts, and the Hermitage&mdash;afternoon sun meanwhile
beating through half-shut persianes in dusty air, and a
peep of greeny-blue hills over the square&mdash;Ruskin lifting his
glass for a birthday toast. There was a certain damsel, whose
own folk called her the Michaelmas goose; he put it more
prettily: "Here's to St. Michael, and Dorrie, and All
Angels!"</p>

<p>Then he went out to see Ilaria.</p>

<p>She was an early flame of his. He must have seen Ilaria
before 1845, but it was in that eventful year he fell in love.
Ilaria was, of course, the marble Lady of Lucca; but falling
in love is not too strong a word.</p>

<p>The Forty-five in the nineteenth century had its Rebellion
almost as full of consequences as the Forty-five of the century
before. The raid of Prince Charlie opened up the Highlands,
and gave us Ossian and Scott and Romanticism; little else.
The raid of John Ruskin, in 1845, for the first time wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
free and working out his own thoughts among the Old Masters
and medi√¶val ruins of Italy, started the whole movement
which made British art decorative and philanthropic. There
were others helping, but he led the way; and it was in that
Forty-five that he "went up the Three Steps and in at the
Door."</p>

<p>The passage in which he first described Ilaria is almost
hackneyed. "She is lying on a simple couch with a hound at
her feet.... The hair is bound in a flat braid over the fair
brow, the sweet and arched eyes are closed, the tenderness of
the loving lips is set and quiet; there is that about them which
forbids breath; something which is not death nor sleep, but
the pure image of both."</p>

<p>Who or what the lady might have been in the flesh he
hardly seems to have cared; at least he never dwelt on the
story. She was daughter of a Marquis of Carretto, and wife
of Paolo Guinigi, chief of a powerful family in Lucca. In
1405 she died. In 1413 Paolo was building that palace with
the tower, now a poor-house, from which he ruled his fellow
townsmen with a rod of iron. She never saw the arcaded
palace, and the frowning, machicolated tower; she could never
have had part or lot in the tyranny of his later rule. We
often read in history of a woman keeping within bounds the
nascent fierceness of a man who&mdash;losing her&mdash;let himself go
and became the scourge of his world. But in all his pride
Paolo remembered the pretty wife, untimely lost.</p>

<p>ILARIA DEL CARRETTO</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head of the Effigy by Jacopo della Quercia in Lucca Cathedral</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The very year he built his castle he tempted away the
greatest sculptor of the age from his native town and thronging
engagements to carve her a tomb. Jacopo della Quercia came
to Lucca in 1413, and six years later left after finishing this and
other sculptures there. He could hardly have known Ilaria;
he must have worked from very insufficient materials in getting
her portrait, and it must have been a tiresome and delicate
business to satisfy his patron, his tyrant. But then Quercia
was "a most amiable and modest man," and he had the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of noble portraiture, "Truth lovingly told." The sort of
critics who do not gush say of this work that it is the first
masterpiece of the Early Renaissance. It has all the best
qualities of medi√¶val art&mdash;its severe symbolism and decorative
effect, with all the best of the later classicism&mdash;its reality,
softness and sweetness.</p>

<p>Paolo's enemies before long drove him out of Lucca, and
the city wreaked vengeance on the tyrant by shattering his
wife's tomb, this masterpiece. Somehow the effigy itself was
spared, and set up again with bits of the wreck against the
bare church wall. It was this dead lady, this marble lady, with
browned, translucent cheeks, and little nose just bruised away
at the tip, that took Ruskin's imagination in his youth. In his
age he wrote, "It is forty years since I first saw it, and I have
never found its like."</p>

<p>For a month, with an interval at Florence, he kept me
pretty closely at work drawing Ilaria&mdash;side-face, full-face,
three-quarters, every way; together with bits of detail from
the early thirteenth-century porch of St. Martin's and other
churches, and some copies in the picture gallery. He painted
hard himself, and never did better work in his life. Two
studies, "half-imperial," of the fa√ßade of St. Martin's are
especially well known; one was at the Academy (winter 1901)
and one at the same time at the Royal Water-colour Society's
Exhibition. He used to sit in quaint attitudes on his camp-stool
in the square, manipulating his drawing-board with one
hand and his paint-brush with the other; Baxter, his valet,
holding the colour-box up for him to dip into, and a little
crowd of chatterers looking on. He rather enjoyed an audience,
and sometimes used to bring back odd gleanings of their
remarks when he came in to luncheon. One ragged boy,
personally conducting a friend from the country, was overheard
enumerating the strangers' meals at the hotel: "They eat
much, much, these English!" Of course, most in the crowd
knew him, or about him. The dean and chapter came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
approve, the choir to grin, and the gendarmes to patronise; a
few French tourists hovered round, but no English that I
remember.</p>

<p>After these long mornings of work&mdash;inside when it rained,
outside when it shone&mdash;we always went for a ramble or a drive.
One venturesome start in a thunderstorm I recollect, for Ruskin
was not the least timid, as you might expect from his highly-strung
temperament. He used to walk planks and look down
precipices, too, like a regular steeple-jack, and handle all sorts
of animals fearlessly. This thunderstorm gave us grand
Turneresque effects, of which I have a sketch, but no description;
but I have borrowed an old letter of the time which
gives a fair sample of an afternoon with Ruskin. It is dated
October 28, 1882.</p>

<p>"A biting scirocco was blowing, but we started in the usual
carriage driven by the boy with the red tie. As we left the hotel
an army of beggars hailed the Professor, who solemnly
distributed pence, to lighten his pocket and his mind. Then
we scampered through the streets, which are all pavement, and
none broader than Hanway Street; but everybody drives
furiously in them as a point of Lucchese and Tuscan honour,
and nobody seems to be run over.</p>

<p>"Out through the city walls you are in the country at once.
Indeed, I can't help thinking of the town as a garden where
houses are bedded out instead of flowers; they are so close
packed, so varied and pretty. But out at the gate it is a wide
stretch of plain with mountains all round, and bright cottages,
cadmium-yellow in the stubble-fields and cane-brakes, for they
thatch the maize-heads over the roofs by way of storage. Out
of one quite decent-looking farm-house a decent-looking woman
came rushing and gesticulating after the carriage. The Professor
called on the driver to stop; and the woman, out of breath,
declared she was the mother of five and wanted charity. He
gave her a note; notes, you know, can be a good deal less than
five pounds in Italy.</p>

<p>THUNDERSTORM CLEARING, LUCCA</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the foot of the hills, south of Lucca, we left the
carriage and walked up the road; Baxter, too, with the
umbrella, coat, camp-stool and geological hammer as usual.
The road goes up through chestnuts and under vines, till you
get to some farms and a church on the top of the buttress-hills,
with a splendid view of Lucca and the valley, behind rich
slopes of autumn colours, and a monastery with its cypresses in
the middle distance. Then we dived into a valley and crossed
a marble quarry, for all the stones here are marble; the road
is mended with marble, and the pigstyes are built of marble;
and then we scrambled up the main hill. There is a sort of
track through chestnut and myrtle and arbutus with scarlet
fruit against the sky. Girls were gathering chestnuts and
arbutus berries&mdash;such a picture!</p>

<p>"So with an hour's scrambling we came out through a
wood of stone pines to the top, a sort of marble platform.
The scirocco had blown us up fine weather; the Carrara hills
were clear, and the Apennines for miles; fantastic peaks, all
sorts of gables, pyramids, cones, and domes. The sea was
ridged and beating hard on the shore of the Maremma; the
bay of Spezia in the distance, and little Lucca, tidy and square
below, tucked into its four walls like a baby in a cot with a
patchwork quilt. I stayed ten minutes to get a sketch, while
the Professor and Baxter howked out a particularly contorted
bit of marble, and then we plunged through the pines on the
back of the ridge to get a view southward. This, you know,
is the wood where Ugolino in Dante dreamed he was hunting
when they had shut him up to starve in the Famine Tower at
Pisa, and it deserves its fame. It is quite another world from
the hot rich valleys below; among the trees there are fresh,
English-looking meadows with daisies very big and very pink,
and beyond&mdash;the wonderful Mediterranean coast, rose colour in
the sunset. Pisa far down there showed every detail distinct,
cathedral and leaning tower like toys; even at Leghorn we
could see the ships in port. It was like looking on the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
from the angels' point of view; a glimpse through the
centuries.</p>

<p>"But the sun was half-way below the sea, and we turned
and raced the darkness down to the valley, along a path some
six inches wide, with a marble precipice below and a clay bank
above. Then the moon rose; a regular conventional Italian
moon, chequering the path like sunshine, lamping the cypresses
and campaniles. Our driver was asleep; we stirred him out
and drove through misty by-roads to the town gates. Out
came the Customs officer. 'Have you anything to declare,
gentlemen?' 'Nothing, sir!' 'Felice sera, signori!' 'A
happy evening, sir!'</p>

<p>"The streets were very quiet though it was not late. By
the Dominican convent, in the moonlight, there was a woman
kissing the great crucifix; few other folk about; and we made
the square ring again when we chased the moon into the plane-trees
and rattled up to the hotel door."</p>

<p>One morning toward the end of October, soon before we
left Lucca, I went to work on a last drawing of Ilaria (since
honoured by Ruskin with a place in his Sheffield museum) and
found the marble wet and fouled. Somebody had been taking
a cast. After long days in the quiet cathedral, among so many
haunting thoughts, studying the face, it had grown almost as
alive to me as it always was to him. Even I felt a little shock.
It was a liberty, somebody taking a cast! At breakfast entered
a not very prepossessing fellow carrying a plaster mask.
Signor Ruskin had asked at the shop; one was now made.</p>

<p>THE MARBLE MOUNTAINS OF CARRARA AND THE VALLEY OF THE
SERCHIO FROM THE LUCCA HILLS</p></div>
</div>

<p>I never saw him more moved. In a storm of anger he left
the room, crying out, "Send him away." Fortunately we had
with us Henry R. Newman, the American artist, then working
for Ruskin at Florence. He could do the talking to the
disappointed, enraged Italian, and got rid of him&mdash;and a
Napoleon of mine&mdash;after awhile. I was thankful to Newman
for getting rid of the cast as well; and when the coast was
clear Ruskin looked in, rather apologetic after his outburst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"I hope you didn't give the fellow anything," he said, and, of
course, I was much too weak-minded to fight the case.</p>

<p>But I still think the object-lesson was well worth a Napoleon.
That ghastly thing was not our Ilaria; any cast is a hard, dead
caricature if once you have really known the living, ancient
marble. And the wrath of Ruskin laid his secret bare. Do
you think he could have stirred the world with mere flourishes
from the pen? Falling in love was not too strong a word for
the feeling that dictated, over Ilaria's marble portrait, his plea
for sincerity in art: "If any of us, after staying for a time
beside this tomb, could see, through his tears, one of the vain
and unkind encumbrances of the grave, which, in these hollow
and heartless days, feigned sorrow builds to foolish pride,
he would, I believe, receive such a lesson of love as no
coldness could refuse, no fatuity forget, and no insolence
disobey."</p>

<p>To gather up the threads it may be worth while noting briefly
the chief incidents in this Italian tour, with a few comments
from Ruskin's unpublished diary, showing how rapidly pleasure
and pain alternated in his moods.</p>

<p>On arrival, walking round the town, first to Ilaria and last
to San Romano, he notes: "Found all. D. G." The next
day he heard of the death of J. W. Bunney, who had done so
much work for him at Venice, notably the large picture of
St. Mark's now in the Sheffield museum. We often thought
Ruskin did not feel these losses, and was a little hard when
news came that old friends were gone. But under the apparent
stoicism there was much real emotion; indeed, some of his later
attacks of mental illness followed such events. I do not say
they were the only causes, but they contributed. In April
1887, the sudden death of Laurence Hilliard, on board ship
in the √Ügean, undoubtedly turned the balance, and intensified
weakness and worry into illness of many months' duration.
In this case he wrote: "A heavy warning to me, were warning
needed. But I fear death too constantly, and feel it too fatally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as it is." I think his fear of death was purely the dread of
leaving his work undone, with some shrinking of the possible
pain; his sense of death was in the growing limitation of his
powers, which he could only forget in the presence of beautiful
landscape. Thus next day, on the Lucca mountains, he "sat
long watching the soft sunlighted classic hills, plumed and
downy with wood, the burning russet of fallen chestnuts for
foreground, thinking how lovely the world was in its light,
when given."</p>

<p>At Florence on Oct. 4: "Hotel Gran Bretagna once more;
good dinner and flask of Aleatico. Nothing hurt of Ponte
Vecchio or the rest." Next morning the pendulum swung the
other way, partly, I am afraid, because he could not get me to
be ecstatic about the Duomo, and I almost argued him into a
good word for Bronzino's "Judith." Then, again, a drive to
Bellosguardo and a beautiful walk made it all right again, and
a visit to Fiesole in sunshine redeemed the character of the
neighbourhood. But the great event was his introduction to
Mrs. and Miss Francesca Alexander, brought about through
Mr. Newman, and followed by a friendship which had a great
and happy influence on his later life. Miss Alexander's beautiful
handwriting, and the pathos of her manuscript "Story of Ida,"
and her pen-drawings to the "Roadside Songs of Tuscany,"
which he then and there bought for "St. George" and the
world, were a great discovery, to him as if he had found "the
famous stone which turneth all to gold."</p>

<p>Returning to Lucca on the 11th he worked with zeal and
power on his drawings of the Duomo, and wrote his diary
with animation. Here is a vignette from it: "Sat. 14th.
Wet afternoon; bought cheese and hunted for honey. Found
the only view from ramparts in the evening. Tanneries and
cotton-mills spoil the north-west side. Girls singing in a
milly, cicadesque, incomprehensible manner. An old priest
standing to hear them&mdash;thinking&mdash;I would give much to know
what!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>During this October at Lucca he was visited by Mr. and
Mrs. E. R. Robson; Mr. Robson was then preparing (or
intended by the authorities to prepare) plans for a museum
at Sheffield, which should hold the collection belonging to
the St. George's Guild. Mr. Charles Fairfax Murray also
came to see him; he, like Randal, Newman, Rooke, Alessandri
and one or two others, was employed by Ruskin on drawings
for this museum. From the 27th to the 29th he went alone
to Florence, on a farewell visit to the Alexanders, returning
to Lucca for a couple of days' work before going to Pisa,
where he had asked Angelo Alessandri, the Venetian painter,
and Giacomo Boni, the Venetian architect, to meet him.
Signor Boni is now world-famous by his antiquarian work at
Rome; one sees his name in the papers, expounding the Forum
to our king in the King's English, with a strange legend of his
Oxford pupilship to Ruskin.</p>

<p>He and Signor Alessandri, however, were not strictly pupils
of Ruskin, who had met them during the winter of 1876-77
at Venice, and, so to say, adopted them. At this second meeting
he liked them and their work more than ever. His character
of them is given in the first of his lectures on returning next
year to Oxford: "Clever ones, yes; but not cleverer than a
great many of you; eminent only, among the young people of
the present day whom I chance to know, in being extremely
old-fashioned; and&mdash;don't be spiteful when I say so&mdash;but really
they are, all the four of them&mdash;two lads and two lassies&mdash;quite
provokingly good." The two lads were Boni and Alessandri,
one of the lady artists was Miss Alexander. But it was a
compliment to his audience to call them cleverer than Boni,
whose great power already showed itself in his keen eye and
square shoulders. Napoleon Bonaparte must have looked
something like him, I thought, when he began to charm the
fierce Republic; but there the comparison ends. Ruskin set
him to measure Pisa cathedral all over, to see why it was so
irregular; and for a little holiday one heavenly morning before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
breakfast, Boni took me up the Baptistery, outside, even to
the skirts of the great St. John on the top of the dome&mdash;all
Pisa beneath, and the Maremma in sheaves of mist as if angels
were haymaking, and the sea and the mountains bathed in blue
atmosphere around.</p>

<p>These days of busy work and evenings of bright talk
were too soon ended, and on November 10 we took our first
stage northward and homeward.</p>

RUSKIN'S MAPS</p>

<p class="inno">Reading the map is as great a pleasure to some people as
reading a story-book. You will see them pore over the atlas
for an hour together, going on dream-journeys. It is a cheap
way of globe-trotting, and gets rid of the discomforts; only one
must have imagination to turn the wriggling hair-lines into
vistas of river scenery, and the woolly-bear shading into forested
crests and peaks against the sunset. It needs a good deal of
imagination to get over the ugliness of most modern maps;
but why should maps be ugly?</p>

<p>That is a question which Ruskin often asked, and he gave
a great deal of trouble and time to the subject: not enough to
carry out such a reformation as his energetic preaching and
teaching did effect in some other things, but perhaps we have
not quite come to the end of the story yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, the map-readers, and all who have known the
bliss of owning a Bible with a "Palestine" for solace during
sermon-time in childhood, or have realised the privileges of even
Bradshaw's ugly chart on a long journey&mdash;all these will not
think it strange to be told that Ruskin was a map-lover too,
and that he was nearly as fond of plans as of pictures. Indeed,
the old complaint against his art criticism was that he wanted
pictures to be maps, decoratively coloured diagrams of nature,
in which you could find your way about, know the points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the compass, latitude, altitude, geology, botany, fauna, flora,
and the universal gazetteer.</p>

<p>He says in the Notes on his Turner Exhibition that he
began to learn drawing by copying maps, and only came to
pictures later. It is a biographical fact that his first use of a
paint-box was to tint seas blue&mdash;not skies; and to ornament his
outline with a good full red and green and yellow. Here is his
first map of Italy, facsimiled from the coloured original. You
see how he tried to be neat, and how he knew, without having
to amend his lettering, to put one D and two R's in "MEDITERRANEAN."
About Germany he was always antagonistic
or inattentive; here, you see, he thinks it is in Austria! It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hardly possible that he was really copying when he made that
characteristic blunder.</p>

<p>GEOLOGY ON THE OLD ROAD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By John Ruskin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Why do we refer to these childishnesses? Because he&mdash;the
art critic and art teacher&mdash;began his art career not by sketching
people or cottages or flowers, but by copying maps; and
because he ended his career in bidding his hearers do likewise.
Of course the value of advice entirely depends upon what you
mean to do with it. If you want to make colourable imitations
of fashionable pictures, don't take Ruskin's word for anything.
If you want to be a scholar in the school of the Old Masters,
then you might do worse than listen to him. They "leant on
a firm and determined outline"&mdash;that is Sir Joshua Reynolds;
they started with painstaking draughtmanship, and added colour
tint by tint; and so he says, "I place map-making first among
the elementary exercises," and so forth, and made his young
pupils begin with simple facsimile&mdash;"If you can draw Italy you
know something about form"&mdash;and then paint the globe with
its conflicting shade and local colour. Afterwards, in setting
one at Turner, he would say, "I want you to make a map of
the subject. Get the masses outlined, and fill in the spaces
with the main colours; and that will do."</p>

<p>The next photograph is from a coloured drawing of the
same size; the pale spaces are pink and yellow and green, and
the Lake of Geneva, which looks rather blotchy in the print, is
more pleasant in ultramarine. This is one of a set of geological
maps made to illustrate the course of the usual tour through
France and the Alps, perhaps, to judge by the handwriting, for
the journey of 1835, when he made special preparations to study
geology. He could hardly carry a bulky sheet or atlas, and so
extracted just what he required, in a series of neat little pages,
put together into a home-made case, ready for use at any
moment. Youngsters who take this kind of trouble are likely
to become men of weight; at least, they get to know how
interesting the world is. Ruskin on a journey was never
bored, unless he was ill; he looked out of window and poked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you up: "Now, put away that book; we are just coming to
the chalk"; or, "Are you looking out for the great twist in the
limestone?" And the changes in the face of the country,
with new flowers and varying crops, were a continual entertainment.</p>

<p>SKETCH OF SPAIN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By John Ruskin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another use of maps to Ruskin was in writing the descriptive
eloquence for which most readers chiefly admire him. I
remember a very good judge of pictures and books once
choosing the best passage of Ruskin&mdash;not that such "bests"
come to much&mdash;and fixing on the bird's-eye-view passage in
which he takes you with the stork and the swallow on their
northward flight over the varying scenery of Europe ("Stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of Venice," II., vi., ¬ß 8; "Selections," I., ¬ß 20). Now this has
all the imaginative charm of Hans Christian Andersen's "Snow
Queen," or George Macdonald's "At the Back of the North
Wind"; but it is nothing more nor less than notes on the map
of Europe&mdash;of course, by a map-lover.</p>

<p>PHYSICAL SKETCH OF SAVOY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By John Ruskin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>To help in such work he collected maps wherever he went.
He kept them in a special set of drawers in his study, some
mounted on spent diagram-cards from his lectures, and some
dropping to pieces with wear and tear. Among these are still his
first map of the Lakes, from Jonathan Otley's or Wordsworth's
Guide, and his old Keller's "Switzerland" of 1844, which he
used forty years later, saying that he did not want the railways,
and no new map showed the roads better. Of favourite towns,
such as Venice and Amiens, there are large scale plans, the best
that could be bought; and of some Swiss districts, like
Neuch√¢tel, there is quite a library of cartology. A highly
detailed map of M√©doc, from a wine advertisement, was found
useful; likewise Britain with the centres of Trinity College,
London, which he kept for its clearness. Philip's "Authentic
Map of England" is endorsed "good common use," and he
even kept close at hand a set of children's dissecting maps.
The Ordnance Survey is fully represented, but because too
much was put into these beautiful six-inch sheets, he has
coloured them fancifully and vigorously, to get clear divisions
of important parts. Clearness and distinctness, every one must
feel, are not the strong points of modern cartography, hence
the use of sketch-maps: such as this of Spain, scribbled on a
sheet of foolscap to keep him in mind of the graceful, swinging
coastline and the proportions of the provinces.</p>

<p>The overloaded modern map is a work of reference&mdash;it is a
dictionary, not a book. Ruskin felt that it was useless for
educational or literary purposes, and he was continually trying
to improve away the detail and to substitute graphic statistics.
One line of this attempt was in the direction of models. Beck's
raised map of Switzerland (1853) was often in use, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
spoilt for him by the shining surface, which catches high lights
and distracts the eye: all models ought to be painted in dead
colours, except the water, which needs the shine for the sake of
transparency.</p>

<p>So, in 1881, when he was working at the physical geology
of the Coniston neighbourhood, he tried to make a model of the
hills and dales, to see how the strike and dip of strata and the
faults and dykes in the rock came out in relation to ups and
downs, lake-basins and crags, and so forth. He found modelling
too tedious to carry out himself, and, with characteristic
oddness in his employment of means to ends, he set his gardener,
the late Dawson Herdson, on the job. Herdson made a very
fair general sketch in clay of the Old Man, and the main
features as seen from the Coniston side; but he had not pegged
out his distances, and when Dow Crag was built up into
emphatic gloom, and Leverswater hollowed into depth, the
smaller heights had no space left for them, and the effect was
altogether too willow-patterned. Then Ruskin put another of
his employ√©s to work, and after much labour the model now in
the Coniston Museum was evolved.</p>

<p>This was intended to be photographed or engraved in a
side-light, as one of a series of physical maps. Another was to
have been Savoy, for which Ruskin made the sketch here shown.
The black Lake of Geneva is dark blue in his drawing; the
valleys are green, and the mountains roughly knocked in with
lamp-black and Chinese white, tinted over with yellow for
limestone, pink for Mont Blanc protogine, and red for gneiss.
Rough as the sketch is, you see the structure of the Alps, the
lie of the land, at a glance. Towns, roads, and all the rest
should be shown, he said, on separate plans.</p>

<p>Towards this purpose he collected bird's-eye views in great
variety, from Maclure and Macdonald's lithograph of the
Soudan, to quaint old panoramas, of which one&mdash;the mountains
seen from the Buet&mdash;is quite like a William Blake design of
Heaven and Hell, and fit to serve as a background to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
mythologies. Also, for their pleasant picturesqueness, he liked
the queer productions of ancient cartographers, such as Edmund
Squib's funny map of China (1655), and a seventeenth-century
production called "The New Map of Muscovy," and "The
Course of the Great River Wolga," by A. Olearius; with
pictures of Russian peasants along the banks, and the camels
of "the Tartar who dwells on the plains of Thibet." Such
maps have the charm of graphic expression; they don't pretend
to be gazetteers, but they take you about the country with the
entertainment of a traveller's tale.</p>

<p>THE HISTORY OF FRANCE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By John Ruskin</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>They are decorative also; that was another appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Ruskin. William Morris has shown in the illustrations to the
Saga Library how maps can become picturesque designs, and
this was much on the lines that Ruskin would have followed.
He might not have inserted dragons of the deep, nor, as in
Drayton's "Polyolbion," nymphs and shepherds on the hills and
lakes, out of all proportion and possibility; but he thought a
map could be far more explanatory and ornamental than the
usual school atlas.</p>

<p>His attempt at a diagrammatic history of France, sketched
on a page of note-paper, was engraved for "Our Fathers have
Told Us"&mdash;his projected school history of the "Nice Things
that have Happened." You see&mdash;and for lack of space I must
leave it for your further insight&mdash;how he designed to show the
roses of Provence and the lilies of France in this garden of
Gaul, at one time feebly struggling, then blowing fully and
freely spreading, then broken in upon by the wild beast of
war; the lily bed trampled and ruined; Aquitaine wasted to
blankness, and so forth. Worked out completely, an atlas
of history on this plan might be as pretty as any picture-book.
A child accustomed to such maps would have little trouble in
remembering the outlines of national growth, and the whole
tedious business of dates and uncouth names would be infinitely
lightened. Perhaps, some day, Ruskin's hint will be taken,
and his suggestions will bear fruit.</p>

<p>He never cared for worship and admiration, when they did
not mean the understanding of his aims, and the carrying out of
his work. He knew his gift was to irrigate, as he said&mdash;to
suggest and stimulate. People called him an egoist; but how
wise in its humility was the close of his preface to "Loves
Meinie!"&mdash;"It has been throughout my trust, that if Death
should write on these, 'What this man began to build, he was
not able to finish,' God may also write on them, not in anger
but in aid, 'A stronger than he cometh.'" And for much that
he has left to do, no greater strength is needed, but only the
glory of going on.</p>

RUSKIN'S DRAWINGS</p>

<p class="inno">In his introduction to the Catalogue of a Ruskin Exhibition at
Boston, U.S.A., in 1879, Professor Charles Eliot Norton wrote
a paragraph which, as the verdict of a severely discriminating&mdash;though
friendly&mdash;critic, is worth reading more than once again.
He said: "The character of this collection is unique. These
drawings are not the work of an artist by profession; there is
not a 'picture' among them. They are the studies of one who,
by patience and industry, by single-minded devotion to each
special task, and by concentrated attention upon it, has trained
an eye of exceptional keenness and penetration, and a hand of
equally exceptional delicacy and firmness of touch, to be the
responsive instruments of faculties of observation and perception
such as have seldom been bestowed on artist or on poet. Few
of these drawings were undertaken as an end in themselves, but
most of them as means by which to acquire exact knowledge of
the facts of nature, or to obtain the data from which to deduce
a principle in art, or to preserve a record of the work of periods
in which art gave better expression to the higher interests and
motives of life than at the present day. These studies may
consequently afford lessons to the proficients in art not less
than to the fresh beginners. The beauty of some of them will
be obvious to an untrained eye; but no one may hope to
appreciate them at their worth who will not, in a respectful and
modest spirit, give time and patience to their study."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>In his childhood, long before he thought of drawing from
Nature, he had learnt great neatness of hand by amusing himself
with copying out his juvenile verses to look like print,
by drawing maps and by making facsimiles of George
Cruikshank's etchings in his "Grimm's Goblins." His father
used to sketch a little in the pre-historic style, and was fond of
pictures; but they never dreamed of making John an artist.
At last, when he was thirteen, and his adopted sister, Mary, was
taking drawing lessons at school with much satisfaction to the
family, he, too, was allowed to "learn drawing." Mr.
Runciman, his master, gave him "copies"&mdash;the old, bold
pencil copies&mdash;which he tried to imitate in a kind of stipple, at
first, but soon picked up the manner, and in a year, as we find
from old letters, was talking like a book about perspective and
composition, and going to begin painting "on grey paper, with
a few of the simplest colours, in order to learn the effects of
light and shade." Mr. Runciman must have been a good
teacher, for this method of his, on grey paper with a few simple
colours, to get light and shade, is exactly what John Ruskin
learnt thoroughly after awhile, and taught energetically in
his turn all his life. But Mr. Runciman could not bring him
to paint in oil, and does not seem to have had much of a
system; for one of John Ruskin's letters in verse to his father,
written early in 1834, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I cannot bear to paint in oil.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">C. Fielding's tints alone for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other costs me double toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wants some fifty coats to be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Splashed on each spot successively."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his later years he used to say that the practical reason
why he never went on with oil painting was that he had to
draw&mdash;and to keep his drawings&mdash;among books and papers,
and oils were messy, and did not smell nice. But no doubt the
real fact was that his drawings were mainly meant for book-illustration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
done for the engraver, and intended, on a small
scale, to get as much form as possible. All his experiments
in oil seem to have been suppressed; though his water-colour
practice, especially in later times, was to use Chinese white, and
often a good deal of it, very nearly as if it had been flake white.</p>

<p>After some feeble attempts by himself at sketching from
Nature, in 1831 and 1832, he went abroad with his parents for
the summer of 1833, and drew diligently. He had received
for a birthday present the volume of Rogers's "Italy," with
Turner's vignettes, and intended to make something like it, in
a book of verses neatly copied out, with vignettes reproduced
in fine pen-work from his sketches on the spot. Whenever
the carriage stopped he would snatch a sketch, and whenever
they put up for the night he would write up his poetical diary.
Coming home, he began his great work, but school lessons
interfered; not before he had half filled the blank book, and
pasted in a number of neat and pretty vignettes, of which the
best is <cite>The Jungfrau from Lauterbrunnen</cite>, reproduced in "The
Poems of John Ruskin," on the same scale.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had come under the influence of Samuel
Prout, whose work his father admired; and on the next tour,
in 1835, Turner was forgotten in the attempt to be Prout.
The drawings of this "great year," as he called it, when they
are put in order, show a wonderful progress from the first stiff
and timid studies, fresh from the attempt to copy Prout's
lithographs, to a free and quite masterly adaptation of Prout's
"line and dot" manner. By the time he reached the Oberland
and Venice, he had "got his hand in," and the subject went
down upon the paper with ease and decision, always abstracted
and mannered, but with a feeling after style which was entirely
Ruskin. Both in drawing and in writing, much as he talked of
truth and simplicity, he was, first and foremost, the stylist:
and through half his life the conscious imitator of other men's
styles&mdash;Hooker or Carlyle, Prout or Turner. But there was
always more of Ruskin than of his model; and even in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
juvenile essays, when style so completely overwhelms fact, as in
some sketches at Venice or Innsbruck, there is a precocious
completeness and charm, as in the art of youthful nations,
early Greeks, pre-Norman English, or pre-Renaissance Italians.</p>

<p>The pen-drawings of this year have less interest, for they
were made from the originals to illustrate another intended
manuscript, and the life, of course, went out of them. Some
of these pen-drawings, as well as some of the original and
superior pencil-drawings, are published in facsimile in the
"Poems" and "Poetry of Architecture" (large editions of
1891 and 1893). Other facsimiles are given in "Studies in
Both Arts" and "Verona." The plates in these volumes very
fairly represent Ruskin's handiwork at different periods, and
are indispensable to any one who wishes to study it. Plates in
"Modern Painters" and "Stones of Venice," nearly all by
engravers <em>after</em> his work, do not represent it in the same
authentic manner.</p>

<p>Before he had completed his new book he wanted more
skill in colour, and took lessons from Copley Fielding, with
no great result, except that the style which he had gained by
practice abroad was lost in trying after new models. The
sketches of his period as an Oxford undergraduate are comparatively
tame and commonplace (1836-1839), though he did
some neat bits for Mr. Loudon's wood engraver to spoil in
the papers on "The Poetry of Architecture," in the <cite>Architectural
Magazine</cite>, which were his first published writings on
art.</p>

<p>In 1840 he broke down in health, after winning the
Newdigate prize for poetry at Oxford, and before taking his
degree. His parents went with him in the autumn to spend
the winter abroad, as a cure for consumption. He did the
best for himself, according to new lights on the subject of
hygiene, by spending nearly all his time sketching in the open
air. Through France to the Loire and Auvergne, round the
Riviera to Pisa and Florence and Rome, we can trace him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his drawings, made now on a new method. David Roberts
had been showing his Syrian sketches, hard pencil on grey
paper, with yellow lights in body colour, and the new style
caught young Ruskin's attention before he started for his
journey, so that he set out with the resolve of being Roberts
now. The same decision of line shows itself on this much
larger scale; he always seems to know what he wants, and to
get it without trouble; though when one remembers that these
half-imperial drawings were done by an ailing lad, supposed to
be within danger of death, it is not a little remarkable to see in
them such evidences of tenacity and pluck.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1841 they moved on to Naples, and
made excursions to Salerno, Amalfi and the neighbourhood,
always with a drawing to bring back; and when he was on his
way home, through North Italy, he wrote triumphantly to a
friend that he had "got forty-seven large and thirty-four
small sketches."</p>

<p>But what he could do with the stimulus of travel he could
not do again in the reaction after it was over. He was not
quite well yet, and went to Leamington to be under a doctor,
in dull lodgings, and without any mountains. Still he drew.
By this time he had dropped David Roberts, and taken up
Turner, whose art he had already thought of defending against
the magazine critics. It was in these circumstances that he
made the <i>Amboise</i>, from a sketch of the year before, and
certain vignettes for engraving, which were published in
"Friendship's Offering," with his poems. In the new Library
edition, vol. ii., photographs from the original <i>Amboise</i>, and
from the old engraving after it, are given, well worth comparing.</p>

<p>He was not naturally a colourist. In later life he found
out for himself the ways and means of producing bits of very
sweet opalescent colour, but at any time was capable of
relapsing into gaudiness, in hours of fatigue or ill-health; and
throughout his earlier life he was much more at home in light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and shade, or in work with the point. It was not that he did
not see and enjoy colour. To judge by his writings, one would
think that he lived for it, almost: and the splendid passage in
the first volume of "Modern Painters," so often quoted for its
word-painting of colour, was written from his diary-notes on
the way back from Naples in 1841. He made a drawing of
the scene he described; one would expect at least an attempt at
"purple, and crimson, and scarlet, like the curtains of God's
tabernacle"; but it is merely washed with faint tints over an
elaborate outline of the architecture.</p>

<p>So the passing mood in sickness, which had led him to try
after Turnerian colour, left him in health, for the more attainable
method of Turner's "Liber Studiorum," and he began, in
1842, to make this his own. A slight pencil blocking out,
firm and emphatic quill-pen to represent the etched line, and
brushwork in brown, rarely in black, sometimes with a little
colour, over paper usually grey&mdash;this was after all the manner
that suited him best, and very nearly what Mr. Runciman had
talked about, ten years before. By degrees, year after year,
the pen work became finer, and the colour more predominant;
the solid white, used at first for high lights, invaded the tints
and gave a mystery to the outline, and in ten years more he
had found out his central style, a manner quite his own,
producing beautiful results but inimitable by engraving,
whether the old style of steel-plate or the new style of photographic
process. That style in turn developed into the delicate
and often dainty water-colour painting of his later years&mdash;passing
by the way through a phase in which the pencil took
the place of the pen, useful for getting notes of architectural
detail and mountain form&mdash;and never quite abandoned, though
the pencil drawings of the later period became a distinct series,
free and emphatic and suggestive, apart from the more
laborious elaboration of his last paintings.</p>

<p>In 1845 he went alone, unaccompanied by parents and
family, to Italy, and found adventures. He made the acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the primitive masters at Lucca and Florence, and
copied a little; then to the Alps to look for Turner's subjects
in the Alpine sketches of 1842, which had so taken his heart.
Turner did not like it; it was dangerous to have a writing
young man looking behind the scenes of imaginative picture
production; but Ruskin found out Turner, and was all the
more enthusiastic for the discovery. He drew the Pass of
Faido, and saw what Turner had seen, and what he had
invented, more wonderful than any transcript from Nature;
and afterwards filled half a volume with the endeavour to
expound the same. Then, with his versatility of sympathy, he
met J. D. Harding, who was not so much his teacher as a
valued friend, and together they went to Venice. One sketch-book
leaf of this time is particularly interesting&mdash;with a pen
and tint drawing of a mill at Baveno on one side, and a slapdash
sunset on the other, almost Harding. These are photogravured
in the "Poems."</p>

<p>The drawings of 1846 were the first serious mountain
studies, afterwards used for "Modern Painters," though many
things intervened. Sickness at first, and the visit to Crossmount
in the Highlands, recorded in some drawings, not his
best; and then "Seven Lamps of Architecture," for which he
studied in Normandy in 1848, and etched the plates himself in
soft ground&mdash;strong, sketchy plates which were thought a
failure at the time, and re-engraved in a queer imitation of the
originals by a professional engraver for the next edition. Then
he set to work upon "Stones of Venice."</p>

<p>He had already some material, but most of the drawings
were made in two winters, November 1849 to March 1850,
and September 1851 to June 1852. Many of the best have
been dispersed, some are in America, but enough remain to
show what a busy time it was, and how much downright drawing
went to the making of that book: how much <em>more</em> drawing,
and of how much finer quality than one can guess at from
reading the book. The large plates in "Examples of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Architecture of Venice" were not only from his sketches, but
from carefully prepared working drawings. For a mezzotint,
like the <em>St. Mark's Portico</em> or the <em>Arch of Ca' Contarini Porta di
Ferro</em>, he drew the outline separately for etching, and made
another drawing with the tint for the completed engraving.
To do a subject over again seemed no grievance with him, and
there are many examples of his patience in trying the identical
view in different aspects or lights, or even redrawing it from
Nature without alteration, merely to get a result more to his
mind. That the result was worth while in the end we need not
stop to declare. "Stones of Venice" was a revelation to architects
and the public, and for a long while exerted an enormous
influence upon English taste. Suppose, for a moment, such a
book had been written, with all the enthusiasm and learning in
the world, by a man who could not draw!</p>

<p>The later volumes of "Modern Painters," which followed
this, owed their success in great measure to the same cause. The
engravings, beautiful as they are, hardly show the originals;
though from the book one knows that its author had dwelt
upon the aspects of Nature with more than a tourist's glance,
and that he had struggled with the problems of art with more
than an amateur's attention. His Aiguilles and Matterhorns,
his Aspen and his mossy stones, his repeated studies from
Turner and the Old Masters, down to the enlargements from
illuminated missals, all tell the same tale of passionate interest
in the subject and penetrative insight into the situation. They
are not, as Professor Norton says, pictures; but incomplete as
they are, there is in them an appeal to which most of those who
love pictures will respond.</p>

<p>During the progress of "Modern Painters," Mr. Ruskin
planned a "History of Swiss Towns," for which he spent several
summers in gathering material. His drawings for this series were
more full of detail, handled with extremest fineness in some parts
and with great breadth, often carelessness, in others; intended
for completion and engraving when time should serve. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
this time never came. He was led into the interests in political
and social economy which, in these later years, with a public
tired of hearing about Ruskin and art, have given him a place
among the prophets. He was led into further studies of the
geology of scenery, lightly touched in "Modern Painters,"
and, during long residence in Savoy and Switzerland, drew Alps
chiefly for their cleavages, and threw the drawings aside. He
was led into botanical and mineral researches, and Egyptology
and Greek coins, and other by-ways, always, however, drawing
as he went, but drawing subjects less interesting to the general
onlooker. But from this backwater he emerged into a new and
more developed style which began to show results in 1866, on
a long summer tour in the Oberland, when he made the sketch
<i>On the Reuss below Lucerne</i>, in "Poetry of Architecture"&mdash;a
combination of such breadth and delicacy as he had hardly
attained before, and much fine work with the point.</p>

<p>Next year but one, 1868, his ancient love for French Gothic
took him to Abbeville. There the new style had full scope in
the delicate drawings of that date, a long way in advance of
old "Seven Lamps" period: and the same kind of work was
continued in the next year at Verona (May to September), a
summer of very busy painting in the company of his two assistants,
Mr. William Ward and the late Mr. J. W. Bunney.</p>

<p>The Abbeville drawings were shown in a semi-public
manner at a little exhibition to illustrate his lecture on the
"Flamboyant Architecture of the Valley of the Somme," at the
Royal Institution, January 29, 1869; and the Verona drawings
at a similar lecture at the same place on February 4, 1870.
The catalogue of the latter is printed in "On the Old Road,"
vol. i., part 2, with twenty pieces marked as his own.</p>

<p>In this year he entered on his duties as Slade Professor
at Oxford, and before long had established a drawing-school
there, which took up a great part of his attention. Of this
period is a sketch "Done with my pupils afield," and he used
sometimes to draw in the school, and often to draw for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
school. A <i>Candle</i>, finely shaded, and various botanical studies,
were meant as "copies" or as examples of the treatment he
proposed to his students; and the catalogue of the Ruskin
Drawing School at Oxford contains a very large number of
items by himself, from the great <i>St. Catherine</i>, after Luini, to
little memoranda of plant forms. Several of these examples
of his hand have been engraved in Mr. E. T. Cook's "Studies
in Ruskin."</p>

<p>In 1870 and 1872 he was again drawing at Venice. The
elaborate beginning of the "Riva de' Schiavoni," and the
effective <i>Rialto</i> (in the possession of Miss Hilliard, Coniston),
done one morning before breakfast, are of the former year. In
1874, after a breakdown in health, he visited Assisi, Rome,
and Sicily, and beside the notes of Mount Etna and Scylla
he brought home a series of careful copies from parts of the
Botticelli frescoes at the Sistine Chapel, and the fully realised,
though not completed, <i>Glacier des Bossons</i>, a remarkable piece
of landscape work. In 1876 he went again to Venice, this
time chiefly to copy Carpaccio, though some of his best later
views of canals and palaces bear that date, or the early part of
1877, for he stayed on until May of that year. <i>Casa Foscari</i>
(in the possession of Mrs. Cunliffe, Ambleside) may be named
as a characteristic example of his daring point of view, and
success in giving the mass of building in steep perspective.</p>

<p>In 1878 an exhibition of his drawings by Turner was held
at the Fine Art Society's Galleries in New Bond Street. During
the show he was taken seriously ill, and while convalescent he
amused himself by arranging a small collection of his own
sketches to add to the exhibition. His catalogue and remarks
are given in the later editions of "Notes on his Drawings by
Turner," &amp;c., 1878. Next year a number of his studies were
shown in Boston, U.S.A., under the management of Professor
Charles Eliot Norton, whose appreciative paragraph we have
quoted.</p>

<p>It seemed as though his working life had come to an end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
at the time, with that crisis of illness. A visit to Amiens in
1880, with Mr. Arthur Severn and Mr. Brabazon, gave him the
subject for writing the "Bible of Amiens," but his sketches were
less vigorous and full. But in 1882 he was ordered away again
for rest; and, as forty years before, he took his rest&mdash;the best
rest for a tired brain&mdash;in sketching. He gradually warmed to
work; at Avallon, in Central France, he began with a few
sketches of detail, but in Italy the ancient love of architecture
took hold of him, and he drew the <i>Porch at Lucca</i> assiduously.
His two chief drawings of this subject were shown in the next
exhibition of the R.W.S., and one of them at the R.A. in
1901. He exhibited on many occasions at the Royal Society
of Painters in Water Colours, having been elected an honorary
member in 1873. He said at the time to a visitor&mdash;"Nothing
ever pleased me more. I have always been abusing the artists,
and now they have complimented me. They always said I
couldn't draw, and it's very nice to think they give me credit
for knowing something about art."</p>

<p>Later than this there is little to chronicle. Ill-health came
down upon him, and his last drawings were done to amuse his
friend of "Hortus Inclusus" in 1886, though he made a few
pencil notes of Langdale Pikes and Calder Abbey in 1889.</p>

<p>After his death an exhibition of his sketches, with some
personal relics and added examples of the art about which he
had written, was held at Coniston in the summer of 1900. It
attracted over 10,000 visitors to the village, and to many was a
revelation of Ruskin in a new character, and of a kind of art
which charmed in spite of all they had been accustomed to look
for in pictures.</p>

<p>In January and February 1901, a similar exhibition was
held at the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours,
London. Many of the drawings then shown, with a large
series of engravings after his work, are on view in the Ruskin
Museum at the Institute, Coniston; where, in 1903, the
Fourth Annual Exhibition contained a further instalment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Ruskin sketches not previously shown in public, giving
examples of his great variety in subject and treatment, ranging
from an early outline of Dover (1831), to sketches at Avallon
and C√Æteaux (1882; see above, <a href="#Page_48">pages 48-51</a>); from geological
studies of Alps to notes of lions and tigers at the Zoo, and the
head of the Venus de' Medici, elaborately shaded; and from
the carefully finished and daintily detailed pen and tint <i>Valley
of Lauterbrunnen</i>, in which the lens is needed to make out
tiny ch√¢lets, smaller than a letter of this type, to large splashes
of water-colour, one of which (on a sheet 42 by 23 inches in
size) is identical in subject with the view by Laurence Hilliard
given at <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a> of this volume.</p>

<p>One pair of sketches among these has a curious biographical
interest. When Turner's <i>Sun of Venice Going out to Sea</i> was
exhibited at the Academy (1843), Ruskin was greatly impressed
with its wonderful colour and truth, but especially with the
reflections and eddies of the calm water, on which he wrote a
well-known page in "Modern Painters" (vol. i. p. 357).
Accustomed to write from notes with pen and pencil, he
forgot, or ignored, the rule forbidding visitors at the Exhibition
to copy the pictures. These are the sketches he made, and
for making them was expelled from the Exhibition.</p>

RUSKIN'S HAND</p>

<p class="inno">It was only the other day that a friend showed me a bundle of
old papers, saying, "Some of these are in his writing, but
I don't know what to make of the rest." I turned them over
and said, "Second volume of 'Modern Painters'; original
manuscript!" He had just found them, rolled up in brown
paper, in a cupboard, where they had been for years. My
friend, who was intimate with Ruskin from his childhood, and
of course knew the Professor's later handwriting well, hardly
believed me; the difference between the early and later styles
is so great.</p>

<p>There may be other letters and papers of Ruskin's in existence
and unrecognised; not, perhaps, unprinted, but still of
great value, even in hard cash. Correspondents who beg for
a Ruskin autograph and a bit of his writing from those whom
they suppose to have plenty, are often surprised to hear that
others have been before them, and that now the only way is
through the dealers at a guinea a page or more. He told me
that he thought the manuscripts of his best-known works had
been destroyed, and no doubt had forgotten that many of them
had been given away to those who treasured them. Since his
death a considerable part has been brought to light, but of the
vast quantity of writing&mdash;notes, rough copies, fair copies, and
letters, done in a busy life of sixty working years&mdash;there
may be much more to find scattered through the world:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
for Ruskin's hand, like Nuremberg's, goes through every
land.</p>

<p>In 1881 a Mr. Atkinson was sent to Coniston to make a
bust of Ruskin. With his usual good nature to every one
who came personally into contact with him&mdash;the roughness was
only that of his sharp pen&mdash;the Professor treated the unknown
as his visitor, found him lodgings and a workshop, and a place
at his table for a great while, during which the bust made but
slow progress. One reason, perhaps, for Mr. Atkinson's difficulty
was that Ruskin had just grown a beard, and the well-known
face was no longer there to mould. "Can't you treat
the beard early Greek fashion; I should like to be a Bearded
Bacchus!" he said. In spite of the admitted failure, he gave
further work to the sculptor in casting leaves and other detail
"for St. George's Schools"&mdash;that visionary object on which
so much labour and thought were spent; and this use of casts
from natural leaves, I am told by Mr. E. Cooke, was really
originated by Ruskin in the Working Men's College days,
though now pretty widely known. Some of Mr. Atkinson's
casts, I may add, are on view in the Coniston Museum. But
the sculptor's chief personal wish was to get a mould of Ruskin's
hand. He used to say that there was more in it than in his
face; at least, it was the most characteristic feature, and
representable in solid form, while the face, depending on the
bright blue eye and changeful expression, evaded him as it
evaded more celebrated sculptors. But Ruskin did not like
being oiled and moulded, and though Mr. Atkinson made
enticing demonstrations on less worthy fingers, till we were all
up to our elbows in plaster of Paris, he never to my knowledge
won his point.</p>

<p>"Such a funny hand," says Browning's lover, "it was like
a claw!" Ruskin's was all finger-grip; long, strong talons,
curiously delicate-skinned and refined in form, though not
academically beautiful. Those whose personal acquaintance
with him dated only from the later years never knew his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
for then it had lost its nervous strength; and in cold weather&mdash;the
greatest half of the year in the North&mdash;the hand suffered
more than the head. But his palm, and especially the back of
the hand, was tiny. When he rowed his boat he held the oars
entirely in his fingers; when he shook hands you felt the
pressure of the fingers, not of the palm. In writing, he held
the pen as we are taught to hold a drawing-pencil, and the
long fingers gave much more play to the point than is usual in
formed penmanship. Knowing that, it is not surprising to find
that his writing varies, not only from one period to another,
but with passing moods. Everybody shows some of this
variety, but Ruskin's hand was as flexible and as impressionable
as his whole being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
He had an odd way, down to the last, of "printing" an
inscription on the fly-leaf of a book or on the mount of a
drawing, in neat, square Roman type, inked between double
lines ruled in pencil. Sometimes giving a present to a favoured
visitor he would say, "Stay, I must write your name in it";
and you expected the well-known autograph cheque-signature,
scribbled with a flourish. But no! Spectacles, and ruler,
and pencil first; two carefully ruled lines, an eighth of an inch
apart; then the cork-handled, fine steel pen, and laborious
regularity of inscription; till the onlooking recipient laughed
outright at all this time and trouble spent on a trifle. But
Ruskin was quite grave about it.</p>

<p>This was a reversion to early habits. His juvenile MSS.,
of which many were kept by his parents and still remain at
Brantwood, contain many pages of similar calligraphy. His
first Latin and French declensions are printed in pencil; at the
age of seven he wrote the first copies of his "Harry and
Lucy" in this way, pencilled first and penned over, thinking he
was an author making a book. Many children do, but not with
his tenacity and taste. In 1828 (age nine) he had brought this
self-imposed education to something like perfection with the tiny
"print" of "Eudosia," page after page showing wonderful
steadiness of hand and eye; and at the end of that year he executed
the masterpiece of childish ingenuity which he described in
the autobiographical "Harry and Lucy"&mdash;the poem in "double
print," all the down-strokes doubled: "And it was most beautifully
done, you may be sure," says the saucy infant, not untruly.
Some of his early mineral catalogues, begun at this time, appear
to have been continued later, though the difference can hardly
be told from any improvement in the penmanship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his ordinary running hand was a shocking
scribble, but in the middle of it he seems to have pulled himself
up continually, or he was pulled up by an overlooking mother,
and the wild scrawl becomes tidy and neat. I suspect that his
earlier home lessons did not include much copybook work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
He developed his own writing like other precocious boys and
girls, though there is some trace of teaching at the very start.
But after 1830 he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior
orders, his "print" for copperplate; the "Iteriad" (1831) is
fair-copied in a large, regular round-hand, and the Tour poems
of 1833 are in a smaller, less anxious, but more formed business
style. One sees the father's influence coming in, and all
his letters to the old-fashioned business man show the obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
desire to please. "My dear papa" is flourished around in the
most approved writing-master's manner, and "John Ruskin"
at the end is in black letter, finishing a sheet of impeccable
commercial-hand, in which the free-and-easy wording contrasts
quite ludicrously with the formal writing.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S HANDWRITING IN 1837</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was only, or chiefly, to his father that such letters were
written. For his mother he had another hand; for his friends
and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. But there,
I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character.
To be a man of strong thought and will, innovator in art,
science, politics, morality, and religion, there never was such a
chameleon, always ready to colour his mind after his surroundings;
all things to all men. To the opponent he was an
opponent; to the admirer an admirer, without at once testing
the sincerity of the admiration or the source of the opposition.
It was the cause of many regretted incidents in public life,
but in private life the ground of his charm. Nobody who
approached him in kindness failed of being met more than
half way, while impertinence and rudeness, however unintended,
struck a discord at once. So much of a chameleon he was,
that he could persuade himself into liking, for the moment,
and for the sake of his companion on the spot, many a thing
he had denounced or derided; and sometimes he could do
curious things out of the same unrecognised sympathy. Once
after a lecture, leading Taglioni to her carriage in the midst of
a crowd of onlookers, I saw him cross the London pavement
with an old-world minuet-step, hardly conscious, I am sure, of
the quaint homage he was paying to the great dancer he had
admired in his boyhood.</p>

<p>Those flourishes of the pen for his father's pleasure never
appear in his own private scribble. His ideas came too quickly
to leave him time for ornament, and he had no need to idle in
dots and circles between the phrases. His spelling was always
good, but he never stopped to punctuate; a dash was enough
for most kinds of stops. Letters of 1845 and 1852 are curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
for the underlining or interlining of long passages, not, apparently,
for emphasis; possibly to mark sections of these general
epistles home for copying. In all this early writing there is an
effort to keep pace with the flow of thoughts, even in the verse;
he wrote so much that mere economy of time must have driven
him at speed to the shortest way of getting the matter down.
In diaries of the period are some shorthand notes which I take
to be his; but if he ever tried shorthand he dropped it soon.</p>

<p>NOTES FOR "STONES OF VENICE"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By John Ruskin (about 1850)</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
The model upon which Ruskin's usual handwriting was at
last formed was his mother's. It is perhaps a commonplace to
say that we all betray in our writing the greatest personal
influence of our earlier years. While penning this very page,
a letter has just been brought to me which at first glance put
me in mind of a friend long since dead: it is from his school-master.
Not Ruskin's father nor any of his teachers appear to
have influenced him like his mother. Her more deliberate
writing was extremely elegant; rather small, moderately
sloping, with a pretty combination of curve and angle, and
capitals carefully formed. In the note-book in which he
composed verses from 1831 to 1838 you can see the development
of his hand from a spiky and cramped boyish scribble to
the more open and slightly more upright style of 1835 and
1836, the year of his matriculation at Oxford; a neat and
educated penmanship, easy to read and regular, though differing
slightly from day to day in size and slope. The backward
switch of his <em>y</em> and forward toss of the tail to his angular <em>t</em> are
already there; and the dainty shaping of capitals, based on
Italic or Elzevir print, like his mother's, with suggestion of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s√©rif</i> in a little elegant curl to <em>H</em> and <em>F</em>. Instead of spasmodic
reform, as earlier, there is perfect steadiness for page after
page.</p>

<p>At Oxford his writing became rather larger and looser,
perhaps from Latin exercises, in which indubitable distinctness
is required. The "Poetry of Architecture" fair copy can be
seen in a facsimile in the new Library Edition; the draft
scribbled in a sketch-book during Oxford vacation is reproduced
(<a href="#Page_141">p. 141</a>); you note the tendency to round the foot of the
down-stroke and the length of the greater limbs of the letters.
He used to tell his secretary to take no notice of a letter in
which <em>h</em> and <em>l</em> looked like <em>n</em> and <em>e</em>.</p>

<p>Leaving Oxford and writing hard at "Modern Painters"
earlier volumes, which cost a great deal of pen-work, he went
back to the smaller hand of voluminous authors, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
constant attention to one subject gave it regularity. But the
letters of the time are naturally more impulsive; indeed, in
1849 there are bits which prefigure his latest style in its upright
and loose sketchiness. From 1849 or 1850 for some years the
chief work was "Stones of Venice," and the note-books and
studies for this are fairly represented by the page on "Sta.
Maria dell' Orto." This is the earlier "Modern Painters"
manner. You see the growing freedom, but it is not yet wild
and whirling.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S HANDWRITING IN 1875</p></div>
</div>

<p>The difference is shown at a glance in comparing this with
the sample of his well-known later hand. It was by the end
of the 'fifties that the regular and tight spikiness began finally
to disappear and give place to far-flung curves. The great
turn in his life which took place about 1860 showed itself in
his penmanship as well as in his thought, and the final style
became formed, which, with merely the differences of better or
worse, lasted until all writing was over. After the summer of
1889 it was at very rare intervals that he took pen in hand.
For some time before his death by mere disuse he seemed to
have lost the very power of writing at all. At last, one day,
being asked for his signature, he set down with shaking fingers
the first few letters of it, and broke off with "Dear me! I
seem to have forgotten how to write my own name!" And
he wrote no more.</p>

<p>There have been authors and journalists whose printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
work, no doubt, exceeds his in quantity; but in reckoning
the sum total of his penmanship we must not forget that every
printed page meant, for him, several written pages, especially
in earlier books; also, that he was a conscientious correspondent,
and every day wrote many letters. It may be set
off against this that he sometimes used the help of an
amanuensis, though he rarely dictated, and it was only when
he had hammered his subject into shape that he had it copied
for the printer. Occasionally in late years he let it be type-written,
but most of his work was done before the age of
type-writers. He would use the most unlikely copyists, as
when he got the little girls of his Brantwood class to write out
his notes. All he asked was a distinct hand and a docile scribe.
His secretary, like the secretary in "Gil Blas," did everything
but write, and sometimes was packing parcels or sweeping
leaves while the valet was copying lectures on Greek art.
Some early MSS. are in the hand of George Hobbs; many of
the later were written by Crawley; none by Baxter. At other
times he requisitioned the young ladies; it was for this that
Mrs. Severn formed her large, round, upright hand, and Miss
Anderson had many a copying task, as well as others whose
work will be valued by collectors for its corrections from the
master's pen, like the quartz which holds the sparkle of gold.</p>

<p>But he taught them to write distinctly&mdash;that was his great
requirement. Once, on a sleepless night, he called me, with
many apologies, to write from dictation. Naturally I wrote fast
to get my job done and return to my slumbers; but he
continually pulled me up with, "I'm sure you're scribbling.
Let me see if I can read it." Out on the fells, taking the dip
and strike of strata, or among the cathedrals making notes and
measurements, he would often warn his assistant of the folly of
hasty scrawling. "I've lost so much time and trouble by my
now bad writing," he used to say.</p>

<p>It has been told already how he was struck at first by Miss
Francesca Alexander's handwriting before he had seen her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
drawing, which afterwards he praised so highly. The distinct
neatness of her beautiful calligraphy appealed to his love for
missals and the lost art, as he feared, of the true scribe. But
of queer and quaint writing he was impatient. Words were to
be read, not played with in decorative affectations. The baser
sort of business-hand roused him to scorn, and he had a sharp
eye for the characteristics of a cranky or insincere correspondent.
When postcards came in, like many others he did
not approve of them and never used them. One of his household
sometimes got postcards written in Runes, and, seeing the
mystic inscriptions, he wanted to know why. "So that people
may not read it," was the answer. "What's the use of that?"
replied Ruskin. "Isn't language given you to conceal your
thoughts?"</p>

RUSKIN'S MUSIC</p>

<p class="inno">"It is well known," says a recent newspaper writer, "that
Ruskin's ear was as deaf to musical sound as his eye was sensitive
to natural beauty." On the other hand, Miss Wakefield,
the celebrated singer and the originator of country Musical
Competitions, has put together a volume of 158 pages&mdash;most
of them, certainly, in rather big type&mdash;under the title of
"Ruskin on Music." The inference, of course, to an unbelieving
world is that he wrote about what he did not understand.
But Miss Wakefield understands; and she says, "what
is to be admired in what he has said of the art is the beautiful
way in which its spiritual meaning and teaching have been
expressed by him, in the short passages which he has devoted
to it, and in which no one has ever excelled him."</p>

<p>For his thoughts on music there is that book to read; but
for Ruskin's quest of music, for his lifelong attempts to qualify
as a musician, there is nothing to show. The story has not yet
been told, because it has little bearing on his life's main work,
and&mdash;to put it roughly&mdash;it is the story of a failure. Perhaps
there are admirers who would rather not know about the
failure; and yet&mdash;you shall judge when you have heard it!</p>

<p>There are still in existence the bound volumes of piano-pieces
and operatic songs which he learnt when he was an
undergraduate at Oxford. One of these volumes is open on
the piano, in our photograph of the Brantwood drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
arranged as it used to be when he strummed a little before
dinner and read at the four candles after dinner. Each piece
is inscribed by the Oxford music-master with the usual vague
respect of Town to Gown in the formula, "&mdash; Ruskin, Esq.,
Ch.Ch." The master does not seem to have known his
Christian name, but he evidently dragged him through a great
deal of Bellini, and Donizetti, and Mozart; and "forty years
on&mdash;shorter in wind, though in memory long" Ruskin had a
keen recollection of these pieces, and liked to go over them
with any young friend, showing how they used to sing "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non
pi√π andrai" or "Prendero quel brunettino</span>," with all the
flourishes. There are his fingering exercises, as elaborately
annotated as all his old books are; he must have spent much
time and taken great pains, in those early days, over his music.
It was not for want of opportunity, nor for lack of intention,
that he did not become a musician.</p>

<p>When he left Oxford he still continued his lessons, especially
the singing. I have never heard of his singing in company,
but I can hardly doubt that the lessons did much for his voice.
Any one who has heard him lecture, or read, or even talk,
knows how resonant and flexible it was, and how thoroughly
under his command. He had naturally a weak chest; he
caught cold easily, and his throat was often affected; but he
always, I think, was able to lecture, and his voice was the first
thing that attracted an audience. The singing lessons were not
without result.</p>

<p>RUSKIN'S PIANO IN BRANTWOOD DRAWING-ROOM</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Before Recent Alterations</span>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In later years his music-master was George Frederick West,
who taught him&mdash;or tried to teach him&mdash;something of composition.
I can remember Mr. West coming to give him a
lesson at Herne Hill, but I don't think I was ever present at
the ordeal. You can imagine that "Dr. Ruskin," as Mr.
West always called him, was a most difficult pupil, wanting at
every turn to know why; incredulous of the best authority;
impatient of the compromises and conventions, the "wohl-temperirtes
Klavier"; and eager to upset everything and start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
afresh. It is Mrs. Severn who can describe these droll interviews
and Mr. West's despairing appeal, "But you wouldn't
be ungrammatical, Doctor Ruskin?"</p>

<p>I am not so sure about that; but Mr. Ruskin learnt what
he wanted. One thing he could do to perfection. He could
easily and readily transpose and copy a song that was too high
or too low, and he liked doing so. It does not imply great
scholarship, but it is wonderful, as Dr. Johnson said of the
performing dog, that he should do it at all. He might have
been spending his time to better purpose, you think?</p>

<p>Music lessons went on, at all available intervals, down to
the close of his active life. At Sandgate in 1887-88 he was
learning from Mr. Roberts. In his lodgings, besides the
cottage piano already there, he got a grand piano and a
harmonium (the last was afterwards given to a chapel in
Coniston), and because he had few chances of hearing music
in that retirement, he engaged a young lady professional to
play of evenings to himself and the friends who were staying
with him.</p>

<p>In his books there are several hard hits at concerts and
concert-goers; but just as he wrote against railways and yet,
he said, "used them himself, few people more," so he was an
energetic concert-goer. On arriving at Paris or any great
foreign town his first question was, "What about the opera?"
With classical Italian opera he was familiar from his youth up.
He loved it, indignant when pestilent modernism hurried the
tempo or took liberties with the well-known score. In London
he usually had a season ticket for the Crystal Palace concerts&mdash;you
remember how he abused the Crystal Palace!&mdash;and when
he was driven away by the "autumn cleaning," a great business
in old Mrs. Ruskin's scrupulous housekeeping at Denmark
Hill, he would stay at the Queen's Hotel in Norwood, "to be
near the Manns concerts."</p>

<p>He has just mentioned Charles Hall√© in "Ethics of the
Dust," but in private letters comes out his real admiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the great pianist. John Hullah was one of his friends; his
copy of Hullah's "Manual" is scribbled with devices for
simplifying the teaching of the keyboard. Indeed, being as
he was a born teacher, and counting as he did music an essential
to education, he even taught&mdash;or tried to teach&mdash;what he knew
of it whenever there was a chance. That class of little country
girls at Brantwood had to learn music too; it was in his time
of failing strength, and the story is tragi-comic; but in such
times the real heart reveals itself through all weaknesses, and
it was a very kindly and earnest nature that made him write
out neat cards of music-lore reduced to its lowest terms for the
cottage lasses whose lives he tried to raise and brighten.</p>

<p>It was only on evenings of actual illness or serious trouble
that he passed the time without music, and he generally
managed to have somebody in the house who could play and
sing. One of his admirations was "Claribel" (Mrs. Barnard),
whom he met at Jean Ingelow's; she sang her own songs to
his great delight. Later, among many, there were the Misses
Bateman and Miss Wakefield; in "Joanna's Care" he has told
his readers about the charm of Mrs. Severn's singing. And it
was not only comic songs and nigger ballads that he would
listen to; he liked fun, as his readers ought to know by now,
and a good funny song, if the tune was sound, made him clap
his hands in a quaint gesture and laugh all over&mdash;the more
that there was much sadness in his thoughts. I remember
Sir Edward Burne-Jones's account of a visit to the Christy
Minstrels; how the Professor dragged him there, to a front
seat, and those burnt-corked people anticked and shouted, and
Burne-Jones wanted to go, and Ruskin wouldn't, but sat
laughing through the whole performance as if he loved it. An
afternoon, to him, of oblivion to the cares of life; an odd
experience; but he would not call it music. "Now let us
have something different," he used to say when he had laughed
enough.</p>

<p>The old songs were his delight, old English and French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and Scotch. German songs, German music, and everything
German, except D√ºrer and Holbein, he could not abide;
German love-songs especially, "songs of seduction," he called
them. He would just endure a bit of Swiss carolling, with its
breezy reminder of the Alps; but the unlucky individual who
tried him with Fesca has cause to remember the event. Haydn
and Mozart he classed with the Italians, and Handel with the
good old standards; but Mendelssohn was not to be named.
Worst of all he misliked execution without feeling: the brilliant
young lady pianist had no welcome from Ruskin. Gaiety, or
else tenderness, appealed; even among the old songs there
were those he cast out of the programme. Of "Charmante
Gabrielle" he said once, "it might do when a king sang
it."</p>

<p>Corelli was one of his favourite composers; that was
another link with "Redgauntlet" and Wandering Willie; and
though he was never a collector of rarities as such, he bought
all the Corelli he could meet with, as well as various old
editions of early music at Chappell's sales.</p>

<p>From about 1880 for some years he took to making little
compositions of his own; curious experiments. It need hardly
be said, and it need never be regretted, that these were not workmanlike
performances. The mere fact of his trying to compose
is curious; and though it is not part of his life's work, it explains
some passages and turns of his thought. It would be really more
wonderful if he had succeeded in learning to be a musician,
along with all the other things he attempted. But look at his
face, in the truthful if not sentimental portrait by Mr. Creswick.
I do not much believe in physiognomy, and yet in the faces of
those who have the gift of execution&mdash;quite a separate power
from intellectual or emotional appreciation, or even from composition&mdash;I
think you notice that the groove which marks off
the wing of the nose, <em>ala nasi</em>, at the top is strongly developed;
sometimes it is so sharp as to be almost a deformity. There is
none in Ruskin's face. That trait may mean nothing; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
fact remains that so able a man spent time and labour in vain
over an art which many learn easily, without a hundredth part
of his general power. In a word, he had a great love for music,
and within certain limits a true taste, but no talent.</p>

<p>There were, however, friends of his who could find his little
tunes interesting and enjoyable, and even pay him pretty compliments
about them. Without attaching too much importance
to it, I venture to quote part of a letter from Ernest Chesneau
(author of "The English School of Painting") to John
Ruskin, dated "Oxford, 12 juin, 1884, 8<sup>h.</sup> ¬Ω a.m."</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Hier √† 5 heures, nous sommes all√©s r√©clamer √† miss
Macdonald junior la chanson de notre John. L'aimable
enfant n'a pas eu le temps encore de l'√©crire et me l'a promise
pour demain; mais pour me consoler de ma d√©ception, que son
fin regard de fillette a bien lue sur mon visage, elle m'en a
chant√© une autre; et je lui ai fait redire la premi√®re. En
√©coutant ces doux petits airs simples, na√Øfs et touchants, ma
m√©moire √©voquait&mdash;sans que ma volont√© y e√ªt part&mdash;le souvenir
d'une grande fugue du vieux Bach que l'orgue de New College
avait fort bien jou√© la veille. Et ma pens√©e inconsciement
associait, rapprochait la magnificence du Bach et la timide
d√©licatesse du Ruskin. Et la douce petite chanson m'apparaissait
comme ces exquises gramin√©es dont la graine, apportie
par les oiseaux du ciel, fleurit aux frontons de marbre des palais
ou aux corniches de pierre des cath√©drales. Et la fleurette

quand les somptuosit√©s cr√©√©es de main d'homme ne seront plus

<p>In "Elements of English Prosody," written 1880, there is a
good deal about his views on music, made sadly unreadable,
not by the error of his ideas, but by his perverse neglect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
recognised technicalities. Among the rest is an attempt at
a setting of "Ye Mariners of England," with bars inserted as
if to mark the feet of the prosody instead of the beat of the
melody, which was part of his scheme, though it naturally
offends a musician.</p>

<p>His little output of musical composition need never see the
light. Once he had "Blow, blow thou winter wind" set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in type, but it was discreetly blotted. The manuscript page of
"On Old √Ügina's Rocks" is in the Coniston Museum for the
curious to behold. Others were little rhymes for children&mdash;the
words printed in his "Poems," or fragments from Scott
and Shakespeare, "How should I thy truelove know," "From
Wigton to the foot of Ayr," "Come unto these yellow sands,"
"From the east to western Ind," and so forth, with a couple
of odes of Horace, "Faune, Nympharum" and "Tu ne
qu√¶sieris." Here, as specimens, it is enough to give a little
scrap from "Marmion," to which he set the air and sketched
the accompaniment; and his own rough draft of a songlet,
of which the words, at any rate, are lovely, and intimately
Ruskin. They might be the motto to the Queen's Gardens of
"Sesame":</p>

RUSKIN'S JEWELS</p>

<p class="inno">A standing treat for Ruskin's visitors was to look at minerals.
Some people, it was known, did not appreciate Turners, but
everybody was sure to show emotion over the diamonds and
nuggets. It was not an ordinary collection, with a bit of this
and a bit of that, samples of all the ores in the handbook; there
were only certain sorts, but each specimen was the pick of the
market and of many years' selection, and every sort was a type
of beauty.</p>

<p>Ruskin was not a "scientific" mineralogist, though he
was an F.G.S. from an early age, and used the word "science"
pretty freely in his writings. He really knew a great deal
about minerals, too; but his knowledge was that of the artist
and collector, taking little notice of the mathematics and
chemistry which you read about, yet finding deep and keen
interest in the forms and colours, the development, the "Life
of Stones," "Ethics of the Dust," as he put it, about which
science, up to his time, had nothing to say. And yet, as he
showed his collection, you could not but feel that this was a
kind of Nature-study not only fascinating, but of real importance.</p>

<p>A standard work, under the heading, "Native Gold," tells
us: "The octahedron and dodecahedron are the most common
forms. Crystals sometimes acicular  ... also passing into
filiform, reticulated, and arborescent shapes; and occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
spongiform," &amp;c. But it does not show you, as Ruskin could&mdash;pulling
out drawer after drawer of his plush-lined cabinets,
and letting you handle and peer into the dainty things with a
lens&mdash;what gold, as Nature makes it, actually is. The scientific
book never asks why some gold is born in the shape of tiny,
solid, squarish crystals, as truly crystals as the uncut diamonds
lying beside them, or the quartz in which they nestle; or why
other samples are spun into hair, or woven into wisps, or
ravelled into knots of natural gold lace; or again, why these
have grown into the shape of exquisitely finished moss, and
those into seaweed leaves, flat and curly, and powdered with
dust of gold crystals, springing from the rough brown stone,
or semi-transparent spar, inside of which you can see them like
flower-stalks in water. Here is quite a new world of wonder
and mystery, and that is the kind of "science" he puzzled
over. Some more solid masses, not water-worn nuggets, are
like a tiny <em>netsuke</em>; he had a miniature cobra, chased with its
scales&mdash;all by the art of Nature; and others so like early
Greek coins that one might fancy they had given suggestions to
primitive mint-masters, who like all good artists modelled their
work on Nature. What a happy world, he used to say, if all
the gold were in its native fronds; and even for jewellery how
much prettier these leaves of gold as it grew, than anything
the manufacturing goldsmith sells you. I have drawn a group
of eight such fronds, arranged as a cross, the centre piece with
two tiny crystals of quartz naturally set into it, a gift from his
collection to a friend, as an instance of what Ruskin called a
jewel: and from his own rapid sketch in colour (over leaf) is a
knot of natural silver wire, for silver, too, has its "arborescent
filiform" shapes.</p>

<p>After gold and silver and diamonds you might think the
interest of the mineral-drawers would begin to wane. But no!
we come to richer colours and still more striking forms. This
big pebble, rosy pink, with hazy streaks inside which catch the
light as you turn it about, and reveal mysterious inner architecture&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
is a ruby; and this also, a bit of frozen
raspberry jam engraved with mystic triangles, one inside
another like a dwarf-wrought seal of a fairy king. Then hold
up this slab of talc to the light; the dark patch in it glows
like a red lamp with the intense colour of the garnet. Lower
down the cabinet there are bunches of beryls, angelica stalks
Queen Thyri would not have scorned; or trimmed by Nature
into quaint likeness to those six-sided Austrian pencils, point
and all: emeralds in short and snapped-off sticks of mossy
green; pale pink rods of tourmaline; clippings of a baby's
hair, but crimson, and so fragile you must not breathe on them&mdash;that
is ruby copper, chalcotrichite; black needles of rutile
piercing through and through the solid, glassy quartz-crystals;
amianthus, plush on a stone, tow on a distaff, waving seaweed
in a motionless aquarium of hard spar. Why were these
dainty things created, or how did they grow, hidden away from
all possible light for their colours to develop or sight of
man to enjoy them, until mining folk dug them up from
their lurking-places? And then there are those which even
when found show little of their beauty until they are polished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
agates, and Labrador spar, and malachites, and fire opals;
what theory of Nature accounts for this latent loveliness? he
would say; how little this kind of beauty is known and
enjoyed by people who are satisfied with jewellery from the
price-list! One of his plans was to form a jewel-museum in
which the curator should exhibit, with lens and leisurely
explanations, such treasures to admiring groups of visitors.
The place, indeed, was fixed, at Keswick; the curator named.
But the curator designate shirked the too responsible honour.</p>

Less for pure beauty but still wonderful were all the many
forms of chalcedony and kindred minerals toward the end of
his entertainment. One is a specimen of hyalite&mdash;a sort of ropy,
waxy glass-bubble holding water inside. He would tell how he
wanted to know why the water was in it, and what sort of
mysterious liquid was so sealed up and treasured by the powers
that be; so he had it carefully sawn asunder and the sacred
ichor collected and analysed. It turned out to be just like
Thames water.</p>

<p>The page photographed from one of his earliest writings&mdash;the
mineral dictionary he made at ten or eleven in a shorthand
which, later on, he could not read himself&mdash;is now in the
Coniston Museum. It shows his very early interest and
diligence, at the time when he cared nothing for pictures or
political economy, but loved Nature in all her ways. This
page begins his juvenile account of Galena, a word which in
later days often brought out a smile and a story. For years,
he said, he was wretched because his great and glorious
specimen of this same Lead Glance had a flaw in it, an angular
notch, breaking the dainty exactitude of the big, black, shining
crystal, otherwise as regular as the most consummate art could
plane and polish it. One day, with the lens, he noticed that
the form of the notch corresponded with the shape of a crystal
of calcite embedded in another specimen. His galena had not
been damaged; it was Nature's work, all the more wonderful
now; and life was still worth living.</p>

<p>Few Ruskin readers know his papers on Agates in back
numbers of the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite>, with their fine coloured
plates illustrating some of the best in his grand series; but this
was one of his pet studies, and it was a great regret of his
declining age that he had never carried it through. By careful
drawing he learned, as any one must, far more of the secrets of
agate-structure than can be found by merely looking and
talking, and he thought that the usual explanation was quite
insufficient; agates were not made in layers poured one after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
another into the hollows of the rock, but by some kind of
"segregation," the withdrawal of different materials from a
mixed mass. This is not the place to discuss his theory; but
only to note that duplicates of his own set, in illustration of his
papers, are now in the Coniston Museum, which indeed was
founded by his gift of a general mineral collection in 1887.</p>

</div>

<p>His "Catalogue of a series of specimens in the British
Museum (Natural History) illustrative of the more common
forms of Native Silica" (George Allen, 1884) to a certain
extent suggests his agate theory. This is well worth looking
through when a visit to the Museum gives the reader an
opportunity of comparing these beautiful stones, many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
presented by Ruskin, who also gave the great jewels he called
the Colenso diamond and the Edwardes ruby (after his friend Sir
Herbert Edwardes, whose life he wrote in "A Knight's Faith").</p>

<p>Another printed catalogue, running to fifty pages, was
written to expound a collection given to St. David's School,
Reigate (the Rev. W. H. Churchill's, now at Stonehouse,
Broadstairs) in 1883. A third collection, similarly catalogued,
was given to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Kircudbright">Kirkcudbright</ins> Museum, and others to Whitelands
College, Chelsea, and the St. George's (now called the Ruskin)
Museum, Sheffield. These do not exhaust the list of his gifts,
but serve to show how eager he was to share his interests with
boys and girls, working men and the big public, who must
surely, he thought, love these phases of Nature's beauty when
they had opportunity of seeing them.</p>

<p>After the illness of 1878 which set him aside from Oxford
work, he took to stones of all sorts with ardour. Even at
Oxford he had not quite forgotten them: the lecture called
"The Iris of the Earth" (given in London, February 1876)
is a poetical miscellany of jewel-lore. While he was at work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
this at Oxford he sent the college messenger round with a pressing
note for one of his pupils to come at once. "I want to
know what <em>gules</em> means. Run to Professor &mdash;&mdash; and Professor
&mdash;&mdash; and find out. The books say it means <em>gueule</em>, the red of
a wild beast's throat, but that is too nasty." "Why not <em>gul</em>?
I think that is Persian for <em>rose</em>," said the pupil. "Wonderful!"
said he; "<em>In the gardens of Gul!</em> Of course!" And down it
went in the lecture.</p>

<p>At Brantwood in the early 'eighties there was a busy time
with minerals. He was trying to get deeper into the secret,
and to look up the more scientific side of the question. He
even got a microscope, and his secretary had to make drawings
of diamond anatomy, which I am afraid only confirmed him in
his distrust of microscopes. He pored over crystallography,
and tried to rub up his mathematics, only to find that nothing
of the sort explained why gold made itself into fronds, and
snow into stars, and diamonds into marvellous domes built up
of shield within shield, round-sided triangles&mdash;not round-sided
after all, but mysteriously straight lines, simulating curves, and
so blended and harmonised and perfected that a good uncut
diamond is perhaps the most bewilderingly beautiful thing in
Nature. Here is one of his sketches giving a diagram of the
big "St. George's" diamond he bought for ¬£1000, and studied,
and made his secretary study, for weeks together. It ought
perhaps to be said that the diagram represents only one facet,
and that this is magnified fully two diameters; the diamond is
large, but not so large as all that. I cannot reproduce the best
drawing made at the time, too elaborate in its attempt at transparency
and detail; "That style of drawing was too utter by
far," he said; but his diagram may give some hint of the reason
why he preached "uncut diamonds" as well as the jewellery of
native gold.</p>

<p>He put his theory into practice more than once; especially
in a fine pendant he gave to Mrs. Severn, who designed the
setting. It is about two and three-quarter inches long, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
including the clasp. Two large moonstones <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i> but
irregular in outline are set in an arrangement of gold leaves and
twigs; among them are nine spikes of uncut sapphire each
about half an inch long, radiating from the moonstones, which
are joined by two uncut diamonds, one round and one triangular;
a quantity of small rubies are dotted about the group
to give contrast of colour. The effect is most picturesque, but
of course it has not the glitter&mdash;the vulgar glitter, Ruskin called
it&mdash;of ordinary jewellery. To see the special charm you have
to look close.</p>

<p>A much more entertaining and to him satisfactory line of
research was in finding illustrations of crystal form and banded
structure among the stones of the neighbourhood, with which
his porch became encumbered, or in sugar and salt and coloured
pastry, or tracing the diffusion of cream in fruit-juice, which
makes a temporary agate. It was more fun for the secretary
too, than working problems in the kitchen after bedtime, the
only chance for a smoke; and who can tackle geometry of three
dimensions without a pipe? If Ruskin had smoked he might
have mastered his Miller and Cloiseaux; but it was better
that he should satisfy himself that their ways were not
his ways. The poetry of jewel-lore can't be stated in terms
of <em>h. k. l.</em></p>

<p>Those pie-crust experiments were everybody's delight.
They are partly told in "Deucalion," illustrated with drawings
by Laurence Hilliard, who became expert at bogus mineralogy
on his own account. After displays of nature's wonders and
Ruskin's eloquence, the visitor at luncheon or tea (tea was at the
dining-room table) often did not know whether to laugh or
look shocked when Laurie made minerals of bread and jam,
or anything handy, irresistibly like; and described them gravely
in the very accents of the Professor, who found it "entirely
lovely," and sometimes even suggestive. He was always looking
out for analogies, and could make bogus minerals too. One
day, showing his jewels to a very young lady, he brought out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
its purple plush nook in the glittering drawer a wonderful
specimen, ropy, arborescent, semi-transparent, lustrous; descanting
the while on stalactitic growth, chalcedony, chrysoprase,
hyalite. "And what is this called?" she asked. "Wax, my
dear; I got it at the candle myself."</p>

RUSKIN'S LIBRARY</p>

<p class="inno">In any strange house, while you wait for your host or hostess,
how much you gather of their tastes and ways from the books
on the table and in the shelves! You cannot help noticing
either the presence or the absence of literature, and you do not
need to open the volumes to guess what sort of reading the
good people like. Well-known bindings and styles of binding
betray them at once; and unless they are abnormally tidy their
pet books are sure to be somewhere in the room they use. Of
course, one must discount the evidence of a cover which too
obviously matches the furniture; and if you are an author, and
expected to call, be not too lifted up on spying your own book
gracefully displayed. You may assume that working books,
professional tools, are in the workshop; and there are few
houses without a certain litter of ephemeral printing, magazines
and library volumes, necessary for intelligent conversation.
But if the people read, you will soon know it, and learn at a
glance much about their tastes and characters.</p>

<p>When you know your friends well enough to browse
among their books you learn still more. The way they cut
their pages, skipping or plodding; and if they ever do scribble
on the margins, what they have marked; and which books are
much used, and which are exiled to top shelves; and how they
are kept&mdash;unbound, or perhaps all too beautifully bound;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
these things tell you more than an autobiography would, more
than many years of ordinary acquaintance.</p>

<p>Ruskin's library was scattered all over his house&mdash;and
though he has been dead these three years, and for many years
earlier made little use of his books, the bulk of them still
remain pretty much as he left them. At one time, when he
was busy upon literary work, he was continually buying, and
every corner was heaped with new purchases and old lots weeded
out to be given away or sold; but the net result of his choice
and taste, what he personally cared for and kept, can be seen by
a visitor at Brantwood&mdash;the books for constant use in the
study, and favourite reading in his bedroom, and the rest dispersed
about the place. Most of these books I remember in
just these same places twenty-five years ago, or more; so that
in taking you into his study I am showing you the workshop
where he wrote "Oxford Lectures" and "Fors Clavigera," and
handling the tools he used.</p>

<p>Art and Political Economy were the main subjects of those
lectures and letters, and I suppose the public assumes that these
were the subjects most interesting to him. Whether you are of
those who think him great on Art but astray on Economics, or
of the later school who have resolved that he never knew anything
of Art, but had real insight and foresight in matters
social and political, you would expect to find evidences of
both&mdash;rows of reference volumes, and all the standard works.
But they are not here; Art and Political Economy are conspicuous
by their absence.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will query my sweeping statement as you take
down a volume of Crowe and Cavalcaselle from the "history
bookcase" to the right of the fireplace: but see, it is only a
stray volume!&mdash;and open it; only a few pages are cut, and
those considerably bescribbled with dissent. Ought he to have
known by heart these authorities on Italian painting? It might
have saved him from an error or two, and from some useless
discussions; but he knew the pictures themselves, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
business was not to write handbooks, but to bring his readers
directly into touch with the generalised human view he took of
painting. There is, however, the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire de l'Architecture</span>"
of Viollet-le-Duc, much used in parts, for he alternately
admired the research and quarrelled with the conclusions of the
great French architect, whose name he persisted in spelling
"Violet." There are some very successful artists whose perspective
is always wrong; and others whose drawing can always
be corrected by an art student; but they can paint pictures!
Ruskin's work is full of little faults; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de minimis non curat</i>;
but he got at the root of the matter, mostly, and he could
make you see it. All the tinkering criticism about his mistakes
only shows that he thought "first-hand," so to say, and wrote
with a full pen.</p>

<p>This bookcase is chiefly made up of Carlyle, Gibbon, Alison,
Milman, and the old standards, of course thickly annotated.
There are also some volumes of Mr. W. S. Lilly, but you
may open them and find no sign of life; Ruskin may have
read but he has not marked. There is his old copy of Lord
Lindsay's "Christian Art" (1847), reviewed by him in the
June <cite>Quarterly</cite> of that year. It is stamped with "Mr.
Murray's compliments," but that must refer to the previous
owner. You see his name in queer cramped pencil "Burgon:
Oriel," with Greek e&mdash;Burgon of the Greek vase, the High
Churchman, whose dark thin face and bright eyes, and humorous
contempt for all "doxies" but his own, make him so well
remembered by Oxford men of the passing generation. There
is something odd in Ruskin's early excursion into primitive
Italian art being, as it were, "<em>vice</em> Burgon, resigned." Then
there is "Roman Antiquities," by Alexander Adam, LL.D.,
1819, doubly ear-marked by "John J. Ruskin," and kept for
his father's sake, and for the sake of his father's old school-master.
Ruskin, at all times, was open to the appeal of
associations; all his judgments about men, women and things
must be corrected by the personal equation, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his biography one can never quite rightly appraise his
works.</p>

<p>The "Bible of Amiens" and some passages in the latest
lectures hint that he was really interested in Anglo-Saxons and
Irish Saints. There is the Venerable Bede, evidently studied,
and the life of St. Patrick&mdash;you know he was always respectful
to the patron of Ireland&mdash;but not a leaf cut! There is J. R.
Green's "Making of England," appreciatively annotated, and
Sharon Turner, much marked and cut down in a reckless way
to fit the shelf. A much worse example of this chopping of
books is Westwood's "Miniatures and Ornaments of Anglo-Saxon
and Irish MSS.," a most valuable folio, from which
Ruskin has sawn the top edge and ripped out all the best plates.
As in the case of his medi√¶val missals, scribbled on the margin
by his irreverent pen, he would say that his books were for
use and not for curiosities. These plates were ripped out, not
for wanton mischief or in vulgar carelessness, but to show to
his classes at lectures. The margins were cut, so that the books
might be put away in shelves or cabinets, clearing the workshop
of a busy man, instead of leaving them about to be mishandled
and dog-eared; for the best of housemaids cannot be expected
always to treat the master's litter as if they loved it. None of
these volumes are so damaged that a little vamping would not
set them right; though of course they would not be the tall
copies prized by bibliomaniacs. But how many of these tall
copies are read by their buyers?</p>

<p>On the other hand he bound some volumes much more
sumptuously than they deserved. On this shelf there is a very
splendid tome, lettered on the back "<span class="smcap">Swisse Histor.</span>," evidently
bound abroad, which on opening you find to be Gaullieur's
"La Suisse Historique," much used for intended work on Swiss
towns; and another grand, thick, bevelled, gilded, crushed-morocco
series lettered "<span class="smcap">Hephaestus</span>," which turns out
to be "Les Ouvriers des Deux Mondes" (Paris, 1857)&mdash;the
only sample we can find of the Political Economy we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
looking for. Nor is there anything of the sort elsewhere in
the room.</p>

<p>On the other side of the fireplace is a nest of shelves filling
the corner; you see it in the picture of Ruskin's study, above
his armchair. These shelves are full of maps and scraps,
presented poems at the top and other gleanings awaiting
removal when he should next put his room in order; old
Baedekers and chess-books lower down, with the set of chessmen
and the little travelling board handy for a game after tea; and
boxes filled with the British Museum reproductions of those
bonny Greek coins, thick, rich and bossy, like nuggets come
to life or fossils in metal.</p>

<p>Over the fire are no books, but, as many pictures of the
Brantwood study have shown, a della Robbia relief, replacing
the Turner which once hung there; and the stuffed kingfisher,
Cyprus pottery and figurines, a bit or two of colour in Japanese
enamel and Broseley lustre, and in the middle of the mantelpiece
the Swiss girl which we have photographed. It is a brown
old wood-carving, nearly a foot high, with the vineyard pruning-hook
(now broken away) and the <em>hotte</em> or creel full of vine-leaves
(they use the word <em>hot</em> for a pannier or creel in the Cumberland
dialect also); and though the drapery is commonplace&mdash;kerchief,
corset and skirt&mdash;there is something of the fine school of
sculpture about the lines, not unworthy of a good Nuremberg
bronze. I do not know how or whence this figure came to the
family, but it was old Mrs. Ruskin's before it was brought
to Brantwood, and here it is, so to say, the very centrepiece of
the house. When he sat writing at his usual place and looked
up, his eye would light on it first of all, before rising to the
Florentine Madonna above or wandering to the Turners on
the wall to the right, or out of window to the lake and mountains
and Coniston Old Hall opposite. What has he not said
about the beauty of the peasant-girl in the fields as compared
with the proud ideals of classic art?&mdash;that the painting we
most need is to paint cheeks red with health, and so on?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Here was always the reminder of that bedrock principle of
his thought. You know how George Borrow describes a
writer who used to find his inspiration in a queer portrait over
the fireplace? This, I think&mdash;though I never heard Ruskin
say so, and perhaps it is rather the symbol than the cause&mdash;gives
us the keynote of his study and the work that went on
in it.</p>

<p>The rest of his library represents not so much his professed
occupation as what you might call his hobbies. To the left,
within reach of the writing-table, all is Botany, and not very
modern botany either. Beyond the cases full of Turners in
sliding frames, and drawers of business papers, all is Geology
and Natural History, mostly out of date, or shall we call it
"classical"? There is Mineralogy, old Jameson, and Cloiseaux,
gorgeously bound, and Miller, and perhaps a larger number
of the handbook class, in French and English, and of more
modern date, than in any other department. There are his old
friends Forbes and Phillips on glaciers and geology, and some
more recent three-volume treatises with uncomplimentary
scribblings on their margins. There is Yarrell's "Birds"&mdash;he
never could endure the cuts; and three sets of Bewick. One of
the most used is Donovan's "British Insects," eight volumes,
with coloured plates.</p>

<p>Opposite you find more botany; the nineteen massive folios
of "Flor√¶ Danic√¶ Descriptio," the twenty-seven volumes of
the old, old <cite>Botanical Magazine</cite>, with the beautiful plates of
Sowerby, the three dozen volumes and index of Sowerby's
"English Botany," the six volumes of Baxter's "Island Plants,"
the nine volumes of Lecoq's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">G√©ographie Botanique</span>," and so
forth; all showing his purely artistic and "unscientific"
interest in natural history. Modern anatomy and evolution
were nothing to him; what he cared about was the beauty of
the creatures and the sentiments that clustered round them in
mythology and poetry.</p>

<p>TWO BOOKS OF RUSKIN'S&mdash;A "NUREMBERG CHRONICLE" AND
HIS POCKET "HORACE"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of poetry and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i> he had a great assortment, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
might be expected, and mostly in volumes interesting for their
history, though not chosen as rare editions. He kept his
grandfather's "Burns," his father's "Byron," his own college
"Aristophanes," with copious lecture-notes and sketches of the
Poetry of Architecture in blank spaces. He had Morris's
"Earthly Paradise," "from his friend the author"; a
"Linn√¶us" that had belonged to Ray, the great Cumbrian
botanist; "A Dyaloge of Syr Thomas More Knyghte" (1530),
with the neat autograph, "ffrancis Bacons booke," apparently
that of the famous Lord Bacon; and, of course, his Scott
manuscripts have been often described by visitors to Brantwood.
One little token of unexpected reverence for a name which
hasty readers might think was not to be spoken in Ruskin's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
study, is a tiny duodecimo in yellow silk&mdash;"Dialogo di Antonio
Manetti," about the size, form, and measurements of Dante's
Hell&mdash;inscribed apparently by the great artist "di Michelagnol
Buonarroti."</p>

<p>Greek authors, and a few translations like Jowett's
"Plato"; Missals and Bibles in medi√¶val Greek and Latin;
a few old printed books&mdash;"Danthe" (1491), and a couple
more "fourteeners"&mdash;but only on subjects in which he was
interested, such as heraldry&mdash;Randle Holmes (1688), and
Guillim (1638), coloured by Ruskin and much marked;
Douglas's "Virgil" (1553), Chapman's "Homer," the original
"Cowley" of 1668, various copies of "Poliphilo," together
with standard poets, complete what may be called the bric-√†-brac
of the shelves above the mineral collection. Some readers
of Omar Khayyam may be interested in his dissent to stanza
34, and energetic assent to 21, 25, 45 and 46, scored on the
margins in the edition of 1879; and some of his artistic
readers, will they be sympathetic or scandalised at his collection
of Rodolph Toepffer's Genevese caricatures? There is very
little about Art in all these lines of books: Millingen's
"Greek Vases," and the still greater work of Lenormant and
De Witte are there indeed, but the only other art books are
those of two old friends, Prout's "Sketches at Home and
Abroad," and Harding's "Elementary Art."</p>

<p>Some of the books he used for special work are in other
parts of the house, and many must have been sold or given
away when they were done with. A number of those he gave
away are in a case at the Coniston Museum, from which we
photograph a fine Nuremberg Chronicle side by side with the
tiny "Horace" he used to carry in his pocket on journeys
abroad. In his bedroom he kept a great deal of favourite
reading for wakeful nights&mdash;Carlyle and Helps, Scott and
Byron, Shakespeare and Spenser, Miss Edgeworth and Madame
de Genlis, and the books of his youth, a most curious collection
of dingy antiquity, with not a few French novels: and elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
are the ponderous tomes from which he gleaned. His
work was not done without much reference to books; but,
after all, it was never compilation. Perhaps it is a truism, but
this look round Ruskin's library gives it some freshness and
force&mdash;that the writing which makes its mark in the world is
not the second-hand, patchwork sort, however laborious and
however learned. He looked at Nature, and wrote down what
he saw; he felt deeply, and wrote what he felt.</p>

RUSKIN'S BIBLES</p>

<p class="inno"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Ruskin et la bible</span>"&mdash;who would have expected it?&mdash;is the
title of a French book, written by a science professor, and
published in Paris.</p>

<p>We all know that his works, from "Modern Painters" to
"Pr√¶terita," are full of the Bible. Sometimes his allusions
and quotations are merely ornamental, and sometimes his
remarks are sharp enough to pain the reader; for Ruskin went
through many phases of faith, or, rather, through a long period
of doubt, from which he came, in his later years, into a new
and very simple acceptance of the Christian hope. But at all
times he took the Bible seriously, and in many a passage he has
made its thoughts and stories live for us with marvellous reality.
Hear him tell the Death of Moses or the Call of Peter in those
well-known pages of his masterpiece, or follow him in "Fors"
through unpalatable deductions from neglected commands, and
you cannot but feel that he was a great preacher, "a man of one
book," and that book was the Bible.</p>

<p>How he was brought up upon it he tells us in his autobiography.
In Coniston Museum not the least interesting of the
Ruskin relics is the Bible from which, as he noted on the fly-leaf,
his mother taught him the paraphrases. Turning it over
one sees how the parts he has named as especially studied,
Psalm cxix. above all, have been soiled; for even little John
Ruskin, model of home-bred boys, was like Tommy Grimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the scamp&mdash;he couldn't always be good&mdash;and continual thumbing
embrowns the page.</p>

<p>It was his mother to whom he owed this youthful training in
a close knowledge of the text, "without note or comment."
This was her Bible in the earlier days. Later in life she laid the
somewhat worn volume aside for a new one, a nonpareil Oxford
Bible with references, 1852, with inscription in her husband's
handwriting&mdash;</p>

<p class="inno">&mdash;and a bearded thistle-head is fastened for a memento on the
fly-leaf. To the end of her life she read in it every day, and
every day learned two verses by heart; she has pencilled on
the margins the dates in her last two years, 1870 and 1871; and
after the daily reading she always put the volume away in its
yellow silk bag with purple strings. This curious habit of
dating came out also in her son's old age; perhaps the modern
psychologist will diagnose in it some form of degeneracy, but
in old times dates were important from a lingering respect for
astrology, which is betrayed&mdash;most likely unintended&mdash;in the
precision with which John Ruskin's father noted the exact hour
of his birth. It is in a Baskett Bible of 1741, with engraved
title-page, and a pencil drawing, probably by John in his boyhood,
stuck in as a sort of frontispiece&mdash;a copy from a picture
of Jesus Mocked. Opposite to it is written: "John Ruskin,
son of John James Ruskin and Margaret Ruskin, Born
8 February 1819 at ¬º past 7 o'clock Morning. Babtized (<em>sic</em>)
20 Feby 1819 by the Rev<sup>d</sup> Mr. Boyd"&mdash;the father, I understand,
of "A.K.H.B." To emphasise the Scottish character of
the family one may note that this volume has bound up with it
at the end "The Psalms of David in Meeter," printed at
Edinburgh, 1738. It is most curious that Mr. J. J. Ruskin, a
distinctly well-educated man, should have made the mistake in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
spelling, and carried on the old tradition of providing material
for the horoscope.</p>

<p>THE BIBLE FROM WHICH RUSKIN LEARNT IN CHILDHOOD,
AND HIS GREEK MS. PSALTER</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another Baskett Bible of 1749, nicely rebound in old red
morocco, handsomely tooled, bears the family's earliest register.
It is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: writted">written</ins> in a big, unscholarly hand in the blank space of
the last page of Maccabees; for this volume contained an
Apocrypha, and the page becoming worn, it was stuck down on
the cover. "John Ruskin, Baptized Aprill 9th, 1732 O.S."
(<em>i.e.</em>, 1733 new style), and then follow the children of this John,
with dates and hours of birth, between 1756 and 1772&mdash;Margaret,
Mary, William, John Thomas, Elizabeth, Robert,
and James. John Thomas, born October 22, 1761, was the
father of John James, the father of John. Like many other
remarkable men who owed their fame to their powers rather
than to their circumstances, Ruskin came of a line of decent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
respectable, bourgeois folk, who read their Bibles, "feared God,
and took their own part when required."</p>

<p>His earliest literary training, so to say, was closely connected
with Bible study: for every Sunday he had to take notes of the
sermon and write out a report of the discourse. One of his
childish sermon-books is preserved in the Coniston Museum,
and a page is reproduced here to show the care of writing and
choice of wording insisted upon. In the stories and verses
with which he amused himself, he learned a good deal of
freedom and ease: in these he learned dignity of style, a
corrective to boyish flippancy. Also he got the habit of thinking
with his pen, so that he nearly always scribbled when most
people would only meditate. His father's Bible (a small pica
8vo, Oxford edition of 1846, on the fly-leaf "Margaret Ruskin
to her husband John James Ruskin, 1850," finely rebound in
tawny leather, gilt) was used by him in later times, and side-lined
vigorously; all the blank spaces are scribbled over with
the thoughts that came as he read.</p>

<p>A PAGE FROM ONE OF THE SERMON-BOOKS WRITTEN BY
RUSKIN AS A BOY</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a grand Old Testament in Greek MS. The
back is lettered "tenth century," but Dr. Caspar Ren√©
Gregory, who spent some time in examining the books at
Brantwood, pointed out that the Greek date for 1463 could
be dimly seen printed off from the lost final leaf. It was
bound in vellum in or after 1817, to judge from the water-mark
in the fly-leaves; the binding alone is worm-eaten,
leaving the body of the book untouched. The pages, a little
waterstained, are written large and quaint with the reed pen,
and adorned with strips of painted pattern and Byzantine
portraits of the authors of the books&mdash;Solomon as a young
king, Isaiah and the prophets in varying phases of grey-bearded
dignity and elaborate robes of many colours, rather coarsely
but very richly painted. Such a book to most would be quite
too sacred for anything but occasional turning with careful
finger-tips, or a paper-knife delicately inserted at the
outer margin of the leaves; not to say too crabbed in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
contractions and old style calligraphy to be read with ease. But
Ruskin read it, and annotated as he read. He did the same
with the Greek Psalter in the Coniston Museum, shown in the
illustration on <a href="#Page_197">p. 197</a>; he did it still more copiously, and in ink,
not merely in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: erasible">erasable</ins> pencil, in his most valuable tenth-century
Greek Gospels, or rather Book of Lessons, from which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
have a page photographed. I am very far from saying that
this is a practice to be imitated; but any one who wishes to
follow Ruskin in his more intimate thoughts on the Bible, at
the time of crisis in 1875 when he was busy on this book, and
when he was beginning to turn from the agnostic attitude of
his middle life to the old-fashioned piety of his age&mdash;any one
who wants to get at his mind would find it here.</p>

<p>THE GREEK GOSPELS, WITH ANNOTATIONS BY RUSKIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the remarks merely comment on the grammatical
forms, or the contractions, or the style of writing. Where a
page is written with a free hand, evidently to the scribe's
enjoyment, he notes the fact; and likewise where the scribe
found it dull, and penned perfunctorily. That is quite like
him, to ask how the man felt at his work! But there are
many curious hints of questioning, and then confessions of his
doubts about the doubts, that go to one's heart to read. "I
have always profound sympathy for Thomas," he scribbles.
"Well questioned, Jude!" "This reads like a piece of truth
(John xviii. 16). How little one thinks of John's being by, in
that scene!" "The hour being unknown, as well as unlooked
for (Matt. xxiv. 42), the Lord comes, and the servant does not
know that He has&mdash;(and has his portion, unknowingly?)."
To the cry for Barabbas (Matt. xxvii. 20) he adds, "Remember!
it was not the mob's fault, except for acting as a mob";
and to verse 24 (Pilate washing his hands)&mdash;"How any
popular electionist or yielding governor can read these passages
of Matthew and not shrivel!" On the parable of the vine,
the earlier note to the verse about the withered branch cast
into the fire and burned is&mdash;"How useless! and how weak
and vain the whole over-fatigued metaphor!" But then&mdash;"I
do not remember when I wrote this note, but the 'over-fatigued
metaphor' comes to me to-day, 8th Nov. 1877, in
connection with the <span title="kath√¥s √™gap√™se">Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·ΩºœÇ ·º†Œ≥·Ω±œÄŒ∑œÉŒµ</span>, as the most precious and
direct help and life." You remember John xv. 9: "As the
Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; continue ye in my
love." That word was the help and life he found.</p>

He used to read his Latin Bibles too, but most of these
were collected rather for their artistic value than otherwise.
Of printed bibles there were few in his library; one, a Latin
version in three volumes, purple morocco, printed by Fran.
Gryphius, 1541, and adorned, as the title puts it, with images
suitable no less for their beauty than for their truth, has the
cuts resembling Holbein's work in "Icones Historiarum
Veteris Testamenti" (Lyons, apud Joannem Frellonium, 1547).
But he loved medi√¶val illumination, and owned too many
thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Bibles, Psalters, and Missals
to be described in this chapter.</p>

<p>Mention may be made of a few, such as the big fourteenth-century
Latin Bible, splendidly written in double columns with
stiff Gothic patterns in red and blue, and dainty little decorative
initials, each a picture. Some of these he used to set his pupils
and assistants to enlarge; and a very difficult job it was to get
the curves to Ruskin's mind. If you made them too circular
he would expound the spring of the lines until you felt that
you had been guilty of all the vices of the vulgarest architect's
draughtsman, an awful character in the true Ruskinian's eyes.
If you insisted on the "infinite" and hyperbolic sweep of the
contour&mdash;and you can't magnify a sixpence into a dinner-plate
without some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti pris</i>&mdash;then you had the lecture on Moderation
and Restraint. But Ruskin was always very good-humoured
and patient in these lessons; in the end a happy
mean was found between Licence and Formality, and such
works as the "Noah's Ark"&mdash;now, I believe, in the Sheffield
museum&mdash;were elaborated. Perhaps photography would have
been a shorter cut; but it should have been capital training, if
one had known what use to make of it.</p>

<p>Then there is a Versio Vulgata MS. of the thirteenth
century, poorly half bound in shabby boards, with a pencil
note&mdash;not by Ruskin, of course&mdash;"bo<sup>t</sup> at Naples 1826 for
21/-." Twice or thrice as many pounds would be cheap for it
now, I suppose. A pleasant story is told by Bishop Nicolson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in his diary of the year when Queen Anne came to the throne,
of his meeting the famous Dr. Bentley on the Queen's birthday
(February 8, 1702), and how the great Cambridge scholar
laughed at the mania for possessing rare editions&mdash;a fancy by
no means exclusively of these latter days. "He ridicul'd ye
Expensive humour of purchaseing old Editions of Books at
extravagant Rates; a Vanity to wch ye present E. of
Sunderland and B(ishop) of N(orwich) much subject. The
former bought a piece of Cicero's works out of Dr. Fr.
Bernard's Auction, printed about 1480, at ye Rate of 3lb. 2s. 6d.
which Dr. Bentley himself had presented to yt physitian, and
wch cost him no more than the odd half Crown." The Bishop
of Barrow-in-Furness in editing the diary has tried to trace the
subsequent fortune of the book for which Bentley thought
¬£3 2s. 6d. too high a price. There seem to have been two
volumes, each of which might answer to the description, sold
at the dispersal of the Blenheim library in 1881; and of these
one fetched ¬£54, and the other ¬£38, both prices greatly
below their market value at the present time.</p>

<p>Very like the last mentioned in Ruskin's collection is his
small thirteenth-century Bible, with minute double-columned
writing, as tiny as newspaper print, but perfectly readable, and
lovely to look at. This is an English-written book, with a
glossary of names at the end; it came from the library of the
Hon. Archibald Fraser, son of the celebrated Lord Lovat.
Another small thirteenth-century Bible is Italian work; a
German MS. Latin prayer-book and psalter dating from about
1220, with rich bold pictures and ornament in broad bands of
blue and burnished masses of gold, bound in grey-green velvet,
was a great treasure. His so-called St. Louis Psalter and the
prayer-book of Yolande of Navarre have been often mentioned
by him, but to go into these would take us away from our
subject&mdash;his Bibles.</p>

<p>AN ILLUMINATED PAGE OF KING HAKON'S BIBLE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The one he prized most is known as King Hakon's Bible,
from a reference on the fly-leaf to King Hakon V. of Norway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It is a small volume (shown in our illustration as standing in
front of the embroidered cover in which his Birthday Addresses
are kept) with 613 leaves of the thinnest vellum, measuring no
more than 4¬º by 6¬º inches, and written in tiny black-letter,
double columned, every page ornamented; there are more than
eighty delicately painted pictures, and hundreds of daintily
coloured initials, a perfect treasury of decorative art. The
binding is of the sixteenth century, and thought to be English;
boards covered with brown leather, brass bosses and clasps, and
stamped with panels of griffins in relief, and the motto repeated
between them of "Jhesus help." The book is French work of
the middle of the thirteenth century, and the black-letter
inscription reads, "Anno dni. M<sup>o</sup>. CCC<sup>o</sup>. X<sup>o</sup>. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">istum librum
emit fr. hanricus prior provƒ´cialis a conventu hathersleu. de
dono dnƒ´. regis Norwegie</span>," which is to say: "In 1310 brother
Henry, provincial prior, bought this book from the Conventus
(whatever that means) at Haderslev (in Sleswig) out of the
gift of my lord the king of Norway." It hardly seems as
though the king had owned the book, as Ruskin believed when
he bought it, but it is not surprising that the keepers of the
National Library at Christiania were disappointed in finding that
it had gone into his hands from Quaritch's catalogue, just too
soon for them; and that the Norwegians sent a scholar to
report upon it, Herr Kristian Koren, and on Ruskin's death
again tried to become possessors, though Ruskin's heirs have,
so far, not seen their way to part with the treasure he so much
valued. To Herr Koren I owe the photograph of one of its
pages, here reproduced.</p>

<p>These were all library Bibles, kept in his study, and used
there; but in travelling he had various little testaments which
he carried with him, such as the set shown in the Ruskin
Exhibition at Coniston in 1900. In his bedroom, for reading
on wakeful nights, he had the "Stereotype Clarendon Press
Bible, Printed by Samuel Collingwood and Co." in six volumes,
one being the Apocrypha, and this, like others, bears marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
much use in notes and pencillings. He had more respect for
the Apocrypha than most Protestant Bible-readers. At one
time (1881) he presented several copies of this Clarendon
Press edition, bound just like his own, to a few friends whom
he hoped to interest in "St. George's work," with the inscription,
"From the Master." To the same he gave little squares
of the pure gold, beaten thin, out of which he meant to strike
his "St. George's coinage," saying, "Now you have taken St.
George's money; and whether you call yourself one or no,
you are a member of my Guild. I have caught you with
guile!"</p>

<p>It is rather curious, and characteristic of his old-fashioned
ways, that he used a bookmarker in his Bible&mdash;a dark blue
ribbon, an inch wide, sewn to a card, on which was the text,
"Day by day we magnify Thee," written and painted with a
fifteenth-century style of ornament.</p>

<p>Quite at the end, his eyesight failed him for smaller type,
and Mrs. Severn bought him a larger-typed Bible, which he
read, or had read to him, constantly, up to his death. The
only bit of his writing in it is a note of his sadder moods,
"The burden of London, Isaiah xxiv."; I suppose he refers
to the words, "Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty
... From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard
songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness,
my leanness, woe unto me!..." Those who read "Fors"
know how little he trusted our imperialistic optimism.</p>

<p>Such a Bible-reader, one might think, would have collected
something in the way of a theological library, what are called
helps to Bible-reading. But no! he read neither commentators
nor modern critics, and I believe he had no interest in anybody's
views about exegesis or analysis. He kept by him a few
volumes of reference: Smith's "Bible Dictionary," Cruden,
the "Englishman's Greek Concordance," Sharpe's "Translation
of the Hebrew Scriptures" (he knew no Hebrew), and
there were two copies of Finden's "Landscape Illustrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the Bible," one for his study and one for his bedroom. But
even these few were little used; to him the plain old text was
the book he studied all through his eighty years, and knew as
not many in this generation know it. Once in his rooms at
Oxford I remember getting into a difficulty about the correct
quotation of some passage. "Haven't you a concordance?"
I asked. "I'm ashamed to say I have," he said. I did not
quite understand him. "Well," he explained, "you and I
oughtn't to need Cruden!"</p>

RUSKIN'S "ISOLA"</p>

<p class="inno">"I gave her that name," he said once, "because she is so
unapproachable."</p>

<p>When he was a very young man he saw her first in Rome.
He had been sent there for the winter because it was supposed
he was going into a consumption. He had certainly been
working very hard at Oxford&mdash;not only doing the necessary
reading for honours, which need kill nobody, but all manner
of literature, art, antiquities and science into the bargain, as
his manner was; and he had taken terribly to heart the loss of
the pretty French girl, on whom his boyish affections had been
set for years. So he was in Rome as an invalid, restless and
discontented; and he didn't like Raphael, and he didn't like
the other things people ought to like. It must have been a
difficult time for his parents; but then one can't expect to
bring up a genius without a certain amount of trouble.</p>

<p>In a while he took a turn, and condescended to go with
them to musical services. They were energetic anti-Romanists;
but they went to St. Peter's to see the show, and to hear
the singing. They thought he was beginning to develop an
interest in music. But it was just the old story.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful Miss Tollemache in Rome that
winter; "a fair English girl," he says, "who was not only
the admitted Queen of beauty in the English circle of that
winter in Rome, but was so, in the kind of beauty which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
only hitherto dreamed of as possible, but never yet seen living;
statuesque severity with womanly sweetness joined. I don't
think I ever succeeded in getting nearer than within fifty yards
of her; but she was the light and solace of all the Roman
winter to me, in the mere chance glimpses of her far away, and
the hope of them."</p>

<p>It was very like Ruskin, and it says very much for the
reality of the romantic ideal he preached, that a few glimpses
of a far-away beauty, whom he had neither the chance nor the
intention of approaching, should have made a man of him, out
of a pining, love-sick boy. Open-air sketching helped him
out of his consumption, or whatever the disease was; but the
moral stimulus and reawakening of healthy imagination and
power to work were given him by this pure enthusiasm for a
beautiful face, fifty yards away.</p>

<p>LADY MOUNT TEMPLE, WHEN MRS. COWPER-TEMPLE, UNDER THE
BEECH-TREES AT A BROADLANDS CONFERENCE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From a painting by Edward Clifford about 1876</span></p></div>

<p>He never saw her again for about ten years, not until she
was a wedded wife. She had married a younger son of Earl
Cowper and his wife, daughter of Lord and Lady Melbourne,
and by second marriage wife of Lord Palmerston. The Hon.
William Cowper was one of the most shining examples of the
type&mdash;one does not see much about it in newspapers or histories,
but private memoirs describe it in all ages, and no doubt it
exists even in this&mdash;the type of good men in great positions,
men who are in the world and very actively engaged in it, but
quite unspotted. He began life as aide-de-camp to the Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland in 1830, and went into Parliament in
1835; he was a Lord of the Treasury in 1845, then a Lord
of the Admiralty, then President of the Board of Health,
Vice-President of the Board of Trade, Paymaster-General,
Chief Commissioner of Works, Vice-President of the Education
Department of the Privy Council, Chairman of Mr.
Fawcett's Committee on the Enclosure Acts; it was he who
saved Epping Forest in 1871, and was prime mover in the
preservation of open spaces and in granting allotments to
the poor; he passed the Medical Bill in 1858, the Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Embankment Bill in 1862-3, and the Courts of Justice Building
Bill in 1863; the "Cowper-Temple Clause," to secure the
reading of the Bible in Board Schools, was his; he was the
great reconstructor of the London Parks and inventor of the
scheme for distributing the Park flowers to hospitals, work-houses
and schools. It would be long to tell how he made
politics philanthropic and brought art into the public service.
After 45 years in Parliament he was raised to the peerage as
Lord Mount Temple, and died in 1888.</p>

<p>All these things are known, or knowable, to the public; but
what is more to the point, Histories of Our Own Times don't
tell us: how the lively Eton boy, always in scrapes, occasionally
flogged, had according to Gladstone's reminiscence "the stamp
of purity, modesty, gentleness upon him in a peculiar degree":
how the dandy officer in the Blues wanted to go into the
Church "as a means of escaping," he wrote, "the imminent
dominion of the sins which it seemed so difficult to avoid":
how the busy M.P. and official, Palmerston's step-son and
favourite, kept through all distractions a perfectly holy and
saintly life, a sense of nearness to God and devotion to His
will, that should put much professional piety to shame.</p>

<p>For instance, in his diary he noted Queen Victoria's
coronation, which, of course, he had attended&mdash;he had dined
with the Queen a couple of days before&mdash;and continued, "The
main object to be pursued in life is communion with God. It
is a good method of testing any way of spending my time to
ask, does it render me more ready for communion with God?"
At twenty-seven he had long known all that evangelical piety
at its best can teach; and he always kept the faith. Ten years
later, his young wife&mdash;the Miss Tollemache of Ruskin's
admiration, and the Lady Mount Temple laid in 1901 to rest by
her husband's side&mdash;asked him, at a large party at the Palmerston's,
what interested him most. "Oh, nothing," he
answered, "compares in interest with communion with my
Master, and work for Him." "This," she added, in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
privately printed volume of <cite>Memorials</cite>, "this was the spirit of
his life, through all the blessed years I lived with him."</p>

<p>So after a long interval during which Ruskin had become
a famous writer, and the girl at Rome had become the true
helpmate of such a man, they met once more. It is rather
curious to compare their two separate accounts of the meeting.
The lady says, referring to the earlier part of her married life,
in the 'fifties and 'sixties, "Another great delight to us at this
time was going up occasionally to Denmark Hill for a happy
day with Mr. Ruskin. It seems that, quite unknown to
myself, he had noticed me when we were in Rome together in
1840! I was then eighteen. It was rather humiliating that
when we met again, after about ten years, he did not recognise
me. We became great friends: I was fond of his cousin
Joan"&mdash;Mrs. Arthur Severn. Ruskin's way of putting it
was rather different, and the mere man doesn't quite see where
the humiliation comes in. He hated going to parties, he says;
but one evening was introduced to a lady who was "too pretty
to be looked at and yet keep one's wits about one"&mdash;that is
very characteristic of him: so he talked a little with his eyes
on the ground. "Presently, in some reference to Raphael or
Michael Angelo, or the musical glasses, the word 'Rome'
occurred; and a minute afterwards, something about Christmas
in 1840. I looked up with a start; and saw that the
face was oval&mdash;fair&mdash;the hair, light brown. After a pause I
was rude enough to repeat her words, 'Christmas in 1840!&mdash;were
you in Rome then?' 'Yes,' she said, a little surprised,
and now meeting my eyes with hers, inquiringly. Another
tenth of a minute passed before I spoke again. 'Why, I lost
all that winter in Rome in hunting <em>you</em>!' It was Egeria
herself! then Mrs. Cowper-Temple. She was not angry; and
became from that time forward a tutelary power, of the brightest
and happiest. Egeria always had her own way everywhere,
thought that I also should have mine, and generally got it for
me."</p>

<p>By the kindness of Mrs. Arthur Severn I have by me the
long series of Ruskin's letters to Lord and Lady Mount
Temple. To any one who knew the people and circumstances
touched upon, they would be most interesting; delightfully
amusing for the most part, but sometimes intensely painful,
where the fiery genius poured out his woes and disappointments,
public and private, into their kindly ears. She was his confidant
in all that unhappy love-story which ended so tragically
for his later life: she was his sympathetic adviser in much of
his work. Mr. Cowper-Temple, too, was a kindly and helpful
friend. In the early days he introduced Ruskin to Palmerston,
and smoothed the way for various plans connected with the
National Gallery and public art-works, many of which owed
their promotion to Ruskin in the first instance. I cannot trace
his direct influence in the philanthropic labours of Mr.
Cowper-Temple and the politicians of his circle; but Ruskin
was personally admired and loved by many of them, and
certainly had an indirect share in much that was done for the
help of the people. When he attempted to found his Guild of
St. George, Mr. Cowper-Temple was one of the Trustees; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
with great faith in the scheme, but with much affection for the
schemer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From a photograph taken in 1889 by Rose Durrant and Son, Torquay</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>After some years of "Mr. and Mrs. Cowper" the acquaintance
warmed into a closer friendship. They became Ruskin's
"<span title=" philos">œÜ·Ω∑ŒªŒøœÇ</span>" and "<span title="phil√™">œÜ·Ω∑ŒªŒ∑</span>", for he always nicknamed his intimates,
and often so whimsically that his letters are quite ludicrously
unprintable. To them he was "St. C."&mdash;Saint Chrysostom,
the "golden-mouthed"; and sometimes, he liked to think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
St. Christopher. When he was very ill at Matlock in 1871
Mrs. Cowper-Temple came to nurse him, and from that time
he was her "Loving little boy," and his friends were his
"Dearest Mama" and "Dear Papa." His view of life was
that he grew younger as the years went on&mdash;and so from
being "Dearest Mama" she became "Darling Grannie," and
he signed "Ever your poor, grateful little boy." It is perhaps
all very absurd; but one certainly does not understand Ruskin
without knowing this queer side of his character, part sentimental,
part grotesque, which creeps out even in his most
serious writing, and makes it so impossible to take his every
word for gospel message. But very often he wrote to her and
of her as Isola&mdash;the island&mdash;"Isola Bella" standing alone and
unapproachable by all ordinary roads, and yet open on all sides
to the waifs of the waves, claiming haven and rest in her
sympathy. Here is the whole of a little note written in a dark
time in his later years: "Is there no Isola indeed, where we
can find refuge&mdash;and give it? I have never yet been so hopeless
of doing anything more in this wide-wasting and wasted
earth, unless&mdash;we seize and fortify with love&mdash;a new Atlantis.
Ever your devoted St. C."</p>

<p>There are very few bits in the letters of general interest.
Of somebody's sketches sent for him to look at he wrote:
"Alas, there's no genius in these drawings. Genius never
exists without intense industry. Industry is not genius, but is
the vital element of it." In Bible reading&mdash;"I noticed,
curiously for the first time, two most important mistranslations.
Fancy never having noticed before that 'Sufficient unto the
day is its evil,' ought to be 'Let the day's evil suffice for it.'
And 'chasteneth' ought in several cases to be merely 'bringeth
up, teacheth!'" Here is what he urged upon his friends in
all seriousness, and most strangely if you think who the friends
were: "You are compromising somehow between God and
Satan, and therefore don't see your way. Satan appears to you
as an angel of the most exquisite light&mdash;I can see that well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
enough; but how many real angels he has got himself mixed
up with I don't know. However, for the three and fortieth
time&mdash;in Ireland or England or France, or under the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ara c≈ìli</i>
perhaps best of all, take an acre of ground, make it lovely,
give what food comes of it to people who need it&mdash;and take
no rent of it yourselves. 'But that strikes at the very foundations
of Society?' It does; and therefore, do it. For the
Foundations of Society are rotten with every imaginable plague,
and must be struck at and swept away, and others built in
Christ, instead of on the back of the Leviathan of the Northern
Foam. Ever your affectionate St. C.&mdash;not the Professor."
It was to Lady Mount Temple he wrote the pretty letter
telling her to arrange her party just as if Christ were coming
to dinner&mdash;it is printed in "Fors Clavigera"&mdash;"I suppose Him
to have just sent Gabriel to tell you He's coming, but that
you're not to make any alterations in your company on His
account."</p>

<p>Perhaps she hardly needed a Ruskin to tell her that: but
she kept the letter, and did what it bade. Those who know
anything about the Broadlands Conferences, those remarkable
meetings of men and women in all ranks and of every shade of
religious belief, come together "for the deepening of spiritual
life," know what singular influence was wielded by Lady Mount
Temple, and how far-reaching that influence has become.</p>

<p>Ruskin used sometimes to visit at Broadlands. One winter
he spent several weeks there, and Lady Mount Temple says in
the volume already quoted: "We found him, as always, most
delightful and instructive company; his talk full and brilliant,
and his kindness increasing to all the house, giving a halo to
life. He set us all to manual work! He himself undertook
to clean out the fountain in the garden, and made us all,
from Juliet (Madame Deschamps, Lady Mount Temple's
adopted daughter) to Mr. Russell Gurney, pick up the
fallen wood and make it up into bundles of faggots for the
poor!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>His friends also came to see him at Brantwood. Mrs.
Arthur Severn has a lively story of an excursion with them to
the Monk Coniston Tarn, a pretty bit of water on the hills,
with a fine panorama of mountains all round, the show-place of
Coniston. It was a foggy morning, but he hoped it would
clear; and they drove up through the woods in expectation,
but it was still foggy. They got out of the carriage and
walked to the finest point of view; still the fog would not lift.
Then Ruskin waved his hand and pointed to the scene they
ought to see; and in his best eloquence, and with growing
warmth described the lakelet embosomed in its woods and
moors, Helvellyn and the Pikes, Bow Fell and Wetherlam, and
the Coniston Old Man. For a moment it seemed as if the
whole was before their eyes; and then they burst out laughing.
"After all," said Lady Mount Temple, "is not this the best
treat we could have?" "And to me," said Ruskin, with his
old-fashioned courtliness, "what view could be so entirely
delightful?"</p>
